okay in the three minutes i have

i cannot speak as fast as you just did

so i won't even try

i'll try to make a couple of basic

points

every economic system in the history of

the world

displays the following pattern is born

it evolves over time and then it dies

and passes away

giving way to another one and part of

that process has always been

the conviction of the people in each

economic system

that sooner or later they can they

should

and they will do better overcome some of

the problems and difficulties they're

facing

and organize a system that better meets

human needs the process is sometimes

relatively smooth other times it's rocky

that varies with the conditions and

particularly with the level of

resistance

from those who don't want to see the

system change

and shift capitalism in my

judgment has been born most would agree

has evolved over the last three

centuries

or so and is now at that last

stage the only question now is exactly

how and when the passing

occurs likewise

in my judgment the yearning for

something better

has built up in capitalism

to a pretty intense level now

whether you look at the debts of

students

whether you look at the mind-bending

inequality

that this system generates over and over

again

unless and until it is revolted against

by masses of people who do something

about the inequality only to discover

that as long as capitalism remains the

tendency to inequality

resumes i think people are also tired

of the instability every four to seven

years

capitalism crashes we've had three

in this new century in its 20 years

yup right on schedule every four to

seven years

millions lose their jobs businesses go

belly up

cities and towns can't get the revenue

they need to provide the services

we depend on one sign of the exhaustion

of this system

a level of money creation a level of

debt creation

we have never seen government debt

corporate debt

personal debt the system is exhausted

and the entire private enterprise system

is now

on 24 7 government life

support i think it's over i think that's

difficult for us all to live through

and we better learn some lessons from

the british empire

from which they have been tumbling for a

century

we could and should do better on the

downswing

than the british have been able to and

the more we talk about it

and discuss it and explore it the better

our chances

to make another progressive transition

to a better system that we all need and

will

benefit from

okay destiny are you keeping us on a

timer

i am all right as of march 2021

americans rank the economy

job markets the handling of the

coronavirus and leadership in washington

as the four most important challenges

facing

our country socialist policies would not

alleviate any of these concerns

countries have tried the socialist

experiment time and time again this has

failed

doctors in cuba moonlight is taxi

drivers countries with socialized health

care haven't fared much better than the

us and their handling of the coronavirus

and any socialist regime will

necessarily involve the bureaucracy of

washington even more heavily in our

economy

any country that has attempted to

realize a fully socialist economy has

either failed completely such as in the

case of the ossr

destroyed large swaths of their economy

such as in venezuela or been forced to

embrace more neoliberal economic

policies to realize true growth in their

economy

such as in china or vietnam liberal

market policies work better in both

theory and practice when it comes to

efficiently allocating resources to

maximizing

the economic productivity of any country

and we've seen this play out time and

time again

across a wide variety of markets and

countries throughout history across the

globe

oftentimes people like richard wolff

will bring up the boom bust cycle as

though it's an inherent flaw of

capitalism but i believe i speak for

most when i say that a boom bust cycle

is preferable to just going bust as so

many socialist countries have

it's also important for us to realize

that no economic organization is in and

of itself inherently more

immoral but rather we ought to view them

as tools to effect some greater output

for our country

that we can later utilize and distribute

in the most fair manner with government

policy to most of our citizens as we see

fit

creating a bigger a bigger pie so to

speak from which all of us can eat

morality and justice should exist in the

realm of government policy we cannot

allow it to blind us to the economic

realities surrounding us

no matter how much we wish a wild lion

not to eat us our desire alone will

never satiate its appetite

while socialism may sound good in theory

the destruction would rot on the wealth

of our country and the oppressive

restrictions it would place on our

businesses would not help the vast

majority of americans

be foolish to enforce protectionists or

socialist policies on our economy while

major developing economies such as india

and china are moving in the exact

opposite direction having realized time

and time again the failures and

socialist planning

socialism implies two major things a

change in both the means and mode of

production the means of production

change in such a way to completely

disallow private investment or ownership

and a change in the mode of production

such that we no longer produce goods and

services for a profit

instead businesses are only started with

the approval of some governmental body

some kind of central planning with the

equal decision making and management of

every worker and the goods and services

produced in any society

are what some government body dictates

irrespective of market forces or the

wants and desires of the citizens

it's likely in the course of this debate

that my opponent will suggest we take

after nordic or western european country

setting that things like socialized

health care or subsidized education or

powerful programs that address many of

the underserved needs of americans today

while this is true i would like to

remind everyone that we've spent the

last decade reminding conservatives that

the government simply providing welfare

has

absolutely nothing to do with socialism

my opponent believes that strong social

safety nets and welfare programs are

important parts of the government

most liberals would welcome him with

open arms me included consequential

there are five major hurdles that no

socialist i've ever spoken to is

adequately addressed and they are as

follows

number one what level of violence is

acceptable for you to reach our social

estate

number two how do we decide which

businesses are allowed to exist in a

socialist society without allowing

private capital investment

three is any form of investment

whatsoever allowed in a socialist

society for an expansion of business

four how are labor markets determined in

a socialist society and five how do we

calculate which goods and services a

nation needs if we do away with the

commodity form

those are my five cool all right so

we're gonna do the open format now for

the next hour

um i don't think i'm gonna need to

moderate too much as long as both of you

just

say something and allow the other person

to speak and don't talk over each other

it should be fine

so uh i guess begin uh now

where do you want to start well let me

let my

can i respond to what was said yeah

um i find this a laughable caricature of

anything i've ever written or anything

that i understand

uh is part of this conversation and i

don't appreciate

being told what i think or what i say or

what i mean

or what i intend i can speak for myself

and that would just be fine if we could

allow each other to do that number one

number two

i have no idea what this silly remark

that i hear so

often is that no socialist society

has succeeded at anything i have no idea

what you're talking about

let me give you an example one of the

most important metrics used in the

economics profession

around the world to assess the

quote-unquote

success of an economic system is the

rate of economic

growth you measure gdp and you look at

how it grows

over time and then you compare one

country to another

to assess their relative success

not as societies because that's a vague

generality

but at this particular metric which we

use in economics

to measure economic growth over time

it's not the only metric but it's a

widely used one

so i'm now going to use it in the 20th

century

the fastest growing metric the fastest

growing

gdp in any country measured

was the soviet union and in the

21st century we're living in the fastest

growing gdp

in the world has been the people's

republic of

china this is not an endorsement of one

or another

economic system it's a statement of fact

verified by any reliable

source of information the un

the project in the university of

california berkeley and

others who keep track of this

so this has to be understood because in

much of the world

economic growth is a shared

objective and goal that these two

societies have

excelled at achieving number one

number two when it comes to socialism it

would be useful

if we all understood what the word means

rather than playing around with

caricatures

for example the notion that socialism is

all about what the government does

has been contested throughout the

history of

socialism and that idea is less

dominant within the socialist tradition

now than it ever was over the last 150

years

for example today one of the most

important

issues for socialists has to do

not with government regulation not with

government owning and operating

businesses not with these bugaboos of

bureaucracy and all the rest of it

but has to do with an objective of

transforming

the organization of production in a

factory in an

office in a store not to have a small

group of people the owner the board of

directors

the tiny little minority at the top that

is a dictatorial power

inside an enterprise making all the key

decisions that the employees

have to live with even though the

minority making those decisions

is not accountable to those employees

that's a socialism of transformation at

the micro

level about which very little could have

been discerned

in the comments preceding these if we're

going to talk about socialism

then we have to talk about what it means

to the people

pushing for it and urging it and those

people have

learned from the 20th and 21st century

just like those who pushed for

capitalism three centuries ago

learned from their early experiments how

to refine how to adjust

and how to change to pretend that that

didn't happen

to trade in old and shrinking

conceptions of socialism

may be good debating ploy but it doesn't

advance our understanding

of anything um okay if you want to be

easier to have a

more of a back and forth rather than um

the super long

monologues so we can respond each other

more if you're okay with that um

just for for a couple of things you said

so i'm trying not to miss you

i just talked slower than you oh yeah no

it's fine it's fine

um my understanding is that um in the

20th century there was a faster growing

economy than the ussr and it was japan

japan still exists today and the ussr

does not i understand that the ussr

did show a huge amount of growth but i

think it's odd to use that

as an example when socialists often

point to the evils of imperialism

and when you point out the fact that

everybody was heavily industrializing

around that time as well i don't think

it's fair to say that the ussr simply

grew on the merits of socialism

uh when there were so many other things

happening at the time and when it was

outgrown by another economy that was

but those are those are the facts i mean

you can play whatever games you want

the fact of the matter is that the

soviet union's performance in the 20th

century

completely outshines that of japan

there's no comparison

in 1917 when the soviet union begins

it is the poorest country in europe by

far

it then goes through 70 years of a lost

world war one of a civil war

of an agricultural collectivization and

of world war

ii which did more damage in russia than

in any other country

none notwithstanding that it was the

poorest country at the beginning of this

horrific story

it ends up in 1965 being the number one

competitor of the united states for

global hegemony

that's only because of its

number one status in economic growth

that achieved the overcoming of all

those horrific losses i'm not arguing in

favor of this or that about the soviet

union

but the fact of its achievement

is a staggering reality that you can

dance

around from here to tomorrow but it

doesn't go away

because it's inconvenient to confront it

and the same thing is true now

if you read pearl box novels about china

before the revolution you will hear

about a society

whose depth of poverty literally blows

your mind

and here they are about to surpass the

united states before the end of this

decade

and that was accomplished by a communist

revolution

and a government that has been run by a

communist

party to this day and yeah

for sure they cleverly opened their

society

up to capitalists to come and join them

but to imagine that the achievement of

the

chinese economy is purely due

to the private capitalists rather than

to the state

economy that's making believe because

you need to have an argument

that puts the success at the credit of

one or the other

the infrastructure the training of the

mass of people

everything that happened in china is as

much a product

of the planning and policies of the

communist government than of any other

factor

and that has to be recognized as well

and none of this is an endorsement

that society has strengths and

weaknesses it has things we can

criticize but we can't make it up

because it's inconvenient to face

the successes they've had and continue

to have

okay so i'm not saying that the ussr did

not grow a lot

obviously the ussr grew massively your

claim is not that the ussr grew

that's not what we're arguing about it's

whether or not the ussr grew at the rate

that it did

due to socialism a country that was

heavily involved in multiple famines

a country that heavily went from little

industrialization to a lot of

industrialization

and a country that engaged in a lot of

imperialistic practices

is a country that grew massively in the

20th century to say that

all of their growth or even the majority

of their growth was due to the

organization of their economy

and not due to factors that were

independent of that organization to say

otherwise that they wouldn't have grown

maybe at an even faster rate now they've

been a capitalist economy

um there would have to be some evidence

provided for that i don't believe that

that's ever been adequately demonstrated

on the contrary i believe some people

have argued

that that russia could have potentially

grown the ussr could have potentially

grown even faster had it abandoned some

of its more outdated

forms of trying to manage their economy

when we bring up

china china has grown a lot under

certain socialist policies for sure

when we look at china especially in the

80s and 90s china began opening itself

up to

massive growth when it comes to foreign

investment china's the number two

country in the world that allows for

foreign direct investment

and the coalescing of all of china's

state-owned the soes estate-owned

enterprises into a select few industries

and then the massive opening of foreign

investment into that country to give

other people more control over privately

owned businesses

has been what has caused the massive

explosion that we've seen of china in

terms of pulling people out of global

poverty

as you mentioned in the video that you

did for the grivel institute you

attribute that to socialist policies but

the thing that really pulled china into

the 21st century in terms of

economic success was the opening itself

up to foreign direct investment was the

opening itself up to other economies

being able to interact with them more

which are all neoliberal trade policies

these aren't these aren't people-owned

businesses these aren't businesses that

are ran by the workers these are

i mean if anything china is a government

that runs the business itself it's a

state capitalist

economy more so than any type of

socialist or communist economy to say

that a single party regime is

having the workers themselves making

decisions over how the any any

individual business is

is uh running i don't think it's fair to

say um i guess one

we're really real quick just finishing

we're just gonna understanding of china

just this last part the thing that

confuses me the most and the thing that

frustrates me the most i guess when i

have

discussions with socialists is socialism

feels like this like

this very amorphous ever transforming

idea of what it actually is

such that i don't even know why we use

the word anymore so i'm very glad that

you've acknowledged that mark's

in in through his labor theory value

analysis was absolutely flawed and was

an absolute failure i'm glad you've

acknowledged that

the way of analyzing not acknowledged

you're making this stuff up i've never

acknowledged anything of the work okay

well

as you don't even know the way you get

this well earlier you just said that we

shouldn't hold ourselves captive to the

thinking of thinkers in the 19th century

in terms of what socialism is so i

assume you've evolved

no no i didn't do that at all i told you

that socialism

has a variety of theories within it it's

a broad tradition

it had to be in 150 years since marx

wrote

his ideas have moved into every country

on this earth at different levels of

economic

and cultural and political life and of

course

those different people all found

something valuable

but they all made their own

interpretations this is a rich diverse

tradition it's as if you you're going to

decide

what it is i mean when i say these

things i never said that the

marxist theory isn't valuable that the

labor theory of value

doesn't apply if you read any of the

books and articles

i've punked out in my life you'd know

that the exact

opposite is the case

wait a minute i want to correct

something about china because you keep

repeating it

okay you know why private enterprise and

private capital flows into china

in the 80s and 90s because china had

transformed itself from a place where

nobody wanted to invest

to a place like now where everybody does

capitalist enterprises went there

because they had a well-educated

disciplined labor force at very low

wages

because they had built an extraordinary

infrastructure

because you had a growing level of

income

for people to buy things that's why

general motors

produces and sells more cars in china

than it does in the united states

the reason private capital went there

was because

they had before the arrival created

the institutions every other part of the

so-called third world

asia africa latin america who had

received since the second world war

massive amounts of foreign aid were

desperately trying to do

what the chinese were doing namely

develop their countries so that

foreign private investment would come

china didn't get any foreign aid because

they were communists

and the united states didn't give them

any but they did a better job than all

the countries who did get it

in order to get to the point of economic

development

where it became interesting for

capitalists in japan and europe to go

there you need to pretend for reasons i

do not understand

that all of the achievements i've just

described

didn't happen that somehow they don't

deserve the credit

look in the world of economics maybe

perhaps you're not familiar

we do exactly what you just said we

ought to do

we look at societies and say they have a

capitalist economic system how did they

do

and they have a socialist system with

the different meanings of that term

and how did they do and then we say

they're different and part not all part

of the story

is the different system and if i say to

you that the

socialist transition tradition has

multiple interpretations

let me assure you that the capitalist

tradition

does as well the leaders of saudi arabia

right now

call themselves capitalists

can i can i ask you when you say

socialist what do you what do you mean

when you say socialist then i'm trying

to understand what this means

can you give me like a cohesive

coherence right that's good no let me

answer

they're a variety i'll give you three

basic strains right now they don't

exhaust it but then we

enable us to have a conversation one

strain

you leave enterprises in the hands of

private capitalists

but you recognize that the capitalist

system is so

flawed for example in terms of

inequality

in terms of business cycle instability

that you give a role to the government

of

massive intervention rules regulations

laws you know let me give you some

examples

in france it's the law that once you

begin working

after graduating from high school or

college every employer has to give you

five weeks of paid vacation from the

beginning

nothing like that exists in the united

states but this is a society that won

that for its people by the way by

socialists who did that

and put that on the books as it is on

most european

countries and socialists do that

because they believe for them that

socialism is when the government comes

in and regulates that's one kind

here's a second kind these second kind

of socialists they don't believe it

works real well if you do that

it's not enough so they want to take a

different step

they want the government to come in and

actually own and operate

enterprises not merely regulate them

with rules

and laws then there's a third kind which

i stressed a few moments ago

which is not about the government

doesn't care all that much

whether the government runs an

enterprise or the private does

they can figure out map whichever one

works better let's be real

practical but for them what socialism

means

is the transformation of the everyday

life

of working people no longer do you go to

work with other people telling you what

to do

where to sit what machine to use what

raw material to work on

and at the end of the day you go home

and you've got nothing more to say

about what you poured your brains and

muscles into no no no

for these socialists like me the crucial

thing is to reorganize

the workplace to bring real democracy

can you believe it to the place where we

work

in a country that claims to be

democratic we don't have democracy in

the workplace

we have a tiny group of people telling

the majority what to do

fully unaccountable to that majority you

know if we really believed in democracy

this kind of socialism argues we would

recognize that that's where adults spend

most of their adult life

at work and if you really believe in

democracy

it should have been installed in the

workplace but

capitalism doesn't permit that the folks

at the top want to keep the power

to keep their inordinate wealth even at

the

expense of no democracy and of a growth

record

inferior to what russia did in the 20th

century

and what china is doing now and that's

an enormous

price to pay okay so if you want to talk

about the

two and three definitions of socialism

that would be interesting to me but i

only heard two

definitions of socials here number one

is just capitalism um i

i don't know when this like redefining

happened of taking capitalism plus

government intervention and calling it

wait let me let me finish

right i don't know why this was the case

that uh state intervention

into private markets to have some form

of regulation or some form of socialized

healthcare

or giving workers five weeks off became

socialism it's clearly not socialism

it's so not socialism that i think marx

himself even said that the state would

be heavily required

in maintaining capitalism uh more so

than i guess even marx was able to

foresee because he predicted a

revolution of the proletariat in his

lifetime

um the idea that the state intervening

and providing some sort of social

welfare or safety net

is is that's just strictly a capitalist

system with some government intervention

if we want to talk about the concept of

the government owning and operating

enterprises or

number three the idea is that the

workers themselves have some like worker

managed thing

i would be interested in discussing

either of those two options as i believe

all five questions i laid out initially

applied to them

but for number one i just i wholly

reject that as a form of capital as a

form of socialism if you believe it is

i'd be curious if you can tell me what

is the difference between

the the first thing you laid out and any

capitalist that acknowledges that some

level of government intervention is

necessary

and keeping the economy going i'd be

glad to explain it to you

the history of socialism gets going in

the middle of the 19th century

and at that time socialists began to

argue

that capitalism was over capitalism was

done

and and a better system was available

and should be pursued

and they had a whole bunch of ideas

about that

they were a relatively small group if

you know the history of marx and marxism

it begins

relatively small as the 19th century

progresses

it gets larger and larger and guess what

happens when that movement gets larger

debates begin to happen inside of it as

to what in the world

capitalism is and what in the world

socialism is and here we go

some of the people decided that

socialism

as a radically alternative system wasn't

in the cards could never happen in some

views

could only happen in a distant future

well what then did socialists

do in the meanwhile before a real change

of system

happened answer advocate for the

government to be taken over by universal

suffrage

the mass of people what institute of

socialism

that was if you like a step in that

direction

an early socialism if you like and by

the way there were big debates pro and

khan

within the socialist movement about this

but they settled to

understand let's call it one kind of

socialism

and that's what you have in western

europe in scandinavia

to this day socialist parties advocate

that

and the people in that society

often vote those folks into power i'll

give you an example

the government in portugal right now a

perfect example european country

the government of portugal is a

coalition of three political

parties the largest is the portuguese

socialist party

the second one is the portuguese

communist party and the third one is the

portuguese green party

they were elected as a coalition

government in 2016.

they were re-elected last year

parenthetically

if your audience members don't know

about this that's because you live in a

society

that doesn't tell you about this even

though it's public knowledge

to anyone interested in finding out

those

parties push a socialist agenda

by which they mean government rules and

regulations

you may not like to call it socialists

but the people

involved and millions of them around the

world

do the other kind of socialism broke

away from this first kind

in the aftermath of the soviet

revolution

they were in favor of taking that extra

step

socialism for them meant that the

government should take over and

operate enterprises at least the

industrial ones

maybe later the agricultural ones and to

underscore their distinction from the

other

socialists who just wanted government

rules regulations and controls

they gave themselves the name communist

that's the only difference between them

and it has been that way

for nearly a century now since the

russian revolution

and then there's this third one which

has to do with transforming the

workplace

those are all socialisms they argue they

debate

they have a rich literature we have lots

of empirical examples

of all three kinds in the world

and if people want to think about how

they work and what kind of society they

produce

there's loads of evidence there we don't

have to hypothesize

or pretend or demonize either because

really

it doesn't lend itself to that if you're

serious

okay first of all just because a

government calls itself socialist i

don't think that that's adequate to

define said government as socialist

right do you agree with it give another

fine you can have enough that's what the

debate is this is to

make up yourself one second yeah okay so

you we have to give destiny a chance to

speak as well wait well so my question

would be like in terms of opportunities

to

give uh yeah i guess i might would you

consider like for instance like the nazi

party would you consider that a

socialist party as they have socialism

in the name it doesn't seem like a good

no why not the minute you know anything

about the

the nazi party you don't understand that

would you say that portugal lives is

portugal a socialist economy

or do they have markets do they have

private investment

markets have nothing to do with

socialism okay can you tell me what is

your definition of capitalism then

i i just because when i ask you what

what is socialism to you i'm

like i understand that you can talk a

lot and you can tell me what other

people have considered socialism to be

but under your current definitions

for instance no no you haven't given me

your definition you've told me what

other thinkers and

other countries in the past your

definition is not what portugal does or

it's not with the portugal

portuguese socialist or communist

parties you're giving me what other

people or other thinkers have thought

what socialism is because

under your current definition number one

the democratic party in the united

states would be considered a socialist

party

because they're in favor of heavy

government intervention in terms of

climate change or health care

and i don't know if you would agree

would you agree that the democratic

party in the united states of america is

a socialist party or if they rebranded

themselves

okay so so it's clear then that the

naming mechanism alone isn't enough for

you because the nazi party obviously

called themselves socialists i don't

think many people me included would

consider themselves socialist

and it's obvious that there must be some

um there must be some outside definition

that you're alluding to

that when you call something socialist

so i'm just trying to figure out

what what is what can you tell me what

is capitalism here what does it mean

when an economy or or a society is a

capitalist economy what does that mean

to you

well let me answer i gave you three

definitions of socialism i told you they

weren't the only three

this is a debate that's been going on

inside socialism

and it's perfectly reasonable for me to

give you those three

it might be nice for you if there was

one you could cling to but that's not

the way it is

the tradition is too big too broad too

global

for there to be one definition as there

is in most

interesting things in the world and

certainly and then many

large organizations and large traditions

i did give you my own my own is focused

on the transformation

of the workplace it's more interested in

the micro

transformation than in the the macro

ones and particularly

skeptical about the power of the

government as having had some bad

consequences i want to learn from these

early efforts to build socialism

so that the future revolts against

capitalism

will have a better outcome than the ones

that we've already had

what does that happen let me finish they

achieved many things we want to hold on

to

and they made some mistakes we want to

avoid and that's exactly what it means

to learn from the past now let me

address the question

of capitalism here's what capitalism is

not distinguished by

and therefore is not useful as a

definition markets

slavery has markets it's a different

economic system

feudalism had markets for much of its

history that's not a definition

of capitalism that's unique capitalism

doesn't uniquely have markets

at silly free or controlled markets

which is all we've ever had in the world

the controlled kind

are as old as as plato and aristotle who

argued

over markets by the way both of them

opposed markets

and thought they were socially

destructive institutions

just for the as a footnote you might be

interested in

but capitalism is unique in one way

it's not a system that's unique in its

markets

it's not a system that's unique in its

quote-unquote free enterprises

those are as old as methuselah but here

is what's unique

earlier systems for example slavery

organized the production of goods and

services around a dichotomy

a slave and a master the master

owned all the equipment all the means of

production

and including the worker himself and

herself

he owned them and that was a very

unusual way of organizing things

but it existed for a long time did it

have markets

often did it sometimes exist without

markets

you bet then there's feudalism radically

different

no master no slave nobody's anybody

else's property

but you know how that works you have a

small group of lords at the top

and a mass of serfs at the bottom and

the way the system works

is that the serfs swear loyalty to the

lord

and the lord in return to the surf and

the whole thing is sanctified

in europe by the catholic church

okay can't wait for captain let me

finish then comes capitalism

it's not a master and a slave it's not a

lord and a serf

it's a completely different arrangement

it's a contract

it's an employer and an employee

they don't swear anything to one another

and neither owns

the other one but they enter into a

contract

in which the employer says i'm going to

give you a wage at the end of the week

you're going to give me your brains and

muscles for these hours

of these days and that's a deal we're

going to make

and that's how we organize production

that's the distinction

of capitalism no that's a lot of keys

it's that's like

you haven't given me a definition of

capitalism at all you've told me a bunch

of things that capitalism isn't and then

you've given me

a bunch of random collected facts of

history but none of these things

absolutely for instance when you talk

about how markets aren't unique to

capitalism that's great worker

management isn't unique to socialism

worker management can exist under a

capitalist system right now i know that

you like to talk about

mondragon a lot mondragon

we're gonna go one at a time here okay

so let this definition then we'll

continue when we talk about worker

managed firms or worker managed co-ops

these things exist under capitalism

what what do you okay well what are you

saying then can i hold on real quick i'm

sorry

can i get an explicit answer um that is

answered within the last 50 years

without going back into

feudalism or what the pope said or the

schism of the catholic church

i i just i want to know very concretely

without moralizing or loading anything

or without talking about something that

happened in 1850 what is capitalism to

you what just can you just tell me or

explain

what capitalism is because it sounds

like yeah yeah go ahead

any definition of anything is they

process

of separating it from that which it is

not

that's all any definition ever was but

we don't typically give

definitions by naming every single thing

that something is not okay

is you differentiate it from a cat

otherwise there's no way to do it

to differentiate and they give a

definition of capitalism

you have to distinguish it from that

which it

is not those other systems didn't use an

employer employee relationship

that is the core distinguishing quality

of capitalism slavery doesn't have that

feudalism doesn't have that

and i never used the phrase worker

management

managers are not what we're talking

about

owning and operating if you want a user

word

it's workers as their own boss workers

as their

own board of directors if you like you

can use the colloquialism in the united

states

that has existed throughout our history

a worker co-op

a cooperative one worker one vote

all decisions majority vote that doesn't

exist in capitalism

that exists in a different relationship

among the people at the workplace not

slavery not feudalism

and not employer employee because those

are different

people in each of those systems worker

co-op that's no longer the case

that's why it's a radically different

socialist

system unlike any of the others how can

you say that that's unlike any of the

others when co-ops can exist today

under capitalist economies slavery can

exist and did it i'm not answering my

question i'm not i don't wanna i wanna

show you the negative or of everything

i'm saying i'm just you're saying today

that this is a unique thing that exists

there's never been a problem in any

society of which we have historical

record

for different class structures different

systems to coexist

you're asking me a question as if it

were we

is this possible it's never been

anything other

than the norm but you're telling me that

in your society

or i could be wrong you can correct me

but it sounds like in your excited in

your society you would exclusively like

firms to be in the hands of workers

which would necessarily preclude

not at all so written that i've never

said it

you're just attributing things okay i'm

sorry i'm trying to train very hard i

don't know what you're saying but the

problems your answers are very

long-winded you're not really answering

my question so

am i to understand then that you are in

favor of a society

where workers have the option to vote on

and have control over the workplace but

there's also room for a private

investment and the government intervenes

in things like health care

or education is this like the type of

society you're aiming for

my guess would be that the transition

from capitalism to what i'm talking

about

would have long periods of time

typically where these different class

structures these different systems

coexist with one another okay that's

what we have today

no you you don't have it in anything

like the way i want it well how do you

want it what's different from your

vision than what we have today

well what we have today is predominantly

capitalist with smatterings of the other

i'm interested in having predominantly

socialist with smatterings of the other

and without that's the difference and

without disallowing private investment

or disallowing

individual owners how do you get there

private investment is a completely

different matter

you can have private investment and

worker co-op how

it exists what's the problem why would i

ever

why would i ever invest in a company

without gaining some amount of equity in

the company they have no obligation to

return to many profit i would never

invest in a co-op

why would you invest in you you invest

in in businesses in the united states

correct because let me finish hoping for

example for something called

a capital gain you hope that if you buy

the shares

and if the company does real well you

will be able to sell the shares at some

future point

to another investor at a higher price

correct if that company's growth is the

product of

its worker co-op organization you're

perfectly happy

if you can make an investment that grows

over time

but in your world those shares don't

exist and first of all there exists were

uh these kinds of enterprises exist in

the world so this is not a hybrid

they're not then they're not worker

co-ops by definition a worker

okay tell me my definition might be

incorrect so you can correct me

my understanding is that what makes

something a worker co-op or what makes

something employee owned

is that the means of production or

whatever firm you operate at

is wholly owned and operated by the

workers meaning that when profits are

generated by that company they're

returned to the workers and when

decisions are made about that company

those decisions are made by the workers

if that is the definition that we're

going by there is no room for private

investment there

right but that's the wrong definition

and not the one that operates in the

world give me your definition definition

of a worker co-op

is that the workers make the key

decisions

they are their own board of directors

they may make the decision

democratically

to raise capital for their business

by selling shares of course they could

do that

those shares would not allow the people

who own them

to do the steps that they can in

capitalism they would not for example be

able

to dictate who's the board of directors

because the workers themselves

are their own board of directors but

there's no problem with private

investment

there never was and my question is

we have this definition i just want to

hone in on this definition okay my

question is

why would any individual ever invest in

a company that does not have a fiduciary

responsibility to their investors

so for instance in your world if i were

to buy 20

of a co-op their workers tomorrow could

say you know what

we're all bored we don't want to do this

anymore we're going to move on we're

shutting the business down

and now i've just completely lost on my

investment because they have no

responsibility to me

because i have non-controlling shares of

the only shares you're selling are

non-controlling

why would any private investment ever

come in knowing that that co-op

never has an obligation to make a profit

or return a dividend to the investors

there's many companies i'm listed on the

stock exchange right now that pay no

dividends to their investors

here in the united states it's a normal

part of our no

absolutely not they might not pay

i'm talking about capital markets 101.

they might not pay a dividend

but they are then you're badly

the foundation of the stock market in

the united states is a returning

of capital to the people that are the

ones doing the investment in companies

now it might be the case as you

correctly point out

it might absolutely it might be the case

really yeah really

you're unaware you're you're most of the

most of the most dynamic companies in

this country

are selling stock to people to whom they

have

no responsibility legal or otherwise

to give them a dividend ever okay

professor do you believe that a dividend

is the only way that you can return

capital to shareholders

that's not the point that absolutely is

the point you made no you made the point

what is the company responsible for

the companies responsible to run the

company they are not responsible to give

money back whether it's dividend return

of capital or

any other way to the people who give

them the money

to buy shares absolutely people who give

them the money

are gambling they hope that they can

sell the shares

for more and they will sell the shares

to anybody who can buy them

the company's not responsible to buy

those shares the company's not

responsible for what price they can get

if they lose their shirt tough luck it's

not an obligation or a responsible

that's the way the law of this country

works

for the stock market and there's no

problem

in a worker co-op saying to investors

we're going to grow better than what you

can get from a capitalist enterprise

so buying a share of our stock will give

you a better shot to sell it at a higher

price

later and i can give you examples i

don't

of a company that did that just so you

can see why an investor would do it

i mean you really you can make the

theater of your hand and i'm not making

the problem is you're just you said

something that's just so on its face

absurdly incorrect about the

characterization of u.s capital markets

you do you not agree that there exists a

legally binding the sec

literally regulates fiduciary

responsibilities to investors i don't

like this trick you've pulled

by making it sound like let me finish

please let me finish let me finish let

me finish you've made it sound as though

i believe the only way to return capital

to shareholders

is through dividends that's absolutely

not the case that's one reading of it

you can return it via stock buybacks you

can return it

uh via increase in growth to do any of

that you absolutely you have a fiduciary

responsibility to your shareholders of

course you do

if you read if you take my advice i

teach these courses

if you read what fiduciary

responsibility means

it's an abstract generalization it can

be

easily demonstrated in thousands of

legal cases

that there is no obligation of any

material sort that they return money

to the people who invest in them it is

perfectly okay

to run your business as you think it

should best be done

short of a committing fraud or illegal

activity

and that would apply in any system the

investor is taking a

chance buying your shares in the hopes

of selling them at a higher price

it happens all the time and it would be

perfectly consistent

with workers who run their own

enterprises and are their own board of

directors

that's not a problem never was there's

nothing inconsistent

with private investment on the one hand

and

worker co-ops on the other now if you

have a worker co-op system

they might decide because we have

democracy now

that they don't want that that they

would like to be the owners

as well as the board of directors of

their own enterprise

that's possible that would be one of the

variations of worker co-op economic

systems

just like we have variations of

capitalist

systems so in a private business in the

united states if i invest my money in a

business a publicly traded business if

they were to cash out all of that money

just close the business down and run

you're telling me that in the united

states that company wouldn't be held

liable for scamming its investors

absolutely that company had a good

lawyer and showed that they made an

honest effort to have a business

and then it didn't work out and they

closed it down the investor would have

absolutely

no standing exactly you're right but you

used a word there an honest effort and

it's doing all the heavy lifting in that

statement of course

you absolutely must show a court that

you are making a good this is part of

your fiduciary responsibility you are

making a good faith effort

to return money that's what the worker

co-op

could easily do we're making a good

faith honest effort

to make a business and that business

requires us to do x

y and z and the private investor got

nothing to do

that happens every day that's not what a

worker co-ops maximizing for though

a worker co-op if by your definition

which is a democratically voted

uh organization is going to be trying to

take into account what their members are

voting for they might not vote in the

best interest of a shareholder

they might vote to do something

completely different understood by the

shareholder that then but that's my

interest

only only the most naive shareholder in

the united states believes

that the company's decisions are

intended to do the best for the

shareholder

i can show you 50 000 legal cases in

which that's not the case

and which it is contested in the courts

and you could have that in a workout

that's

great and i can show you that and i can

show you the dow jones the nasdaq and

the s p

500 we could go to the uk and look at

the ftse 250 the ftse one and i can show

you histories of markets where companies

do reliably over long periods of time

return profits whether in the form of

dividends or the increase in your share

price

to people that invest in those companies

i'm sure you can show me a lot of things

that happen

that are bad in capital markets where

companies uh scam people much because i

can show you bad things that happen like

famines under the ussr

but pointing out to a few bad actors

does not clear up the problem of the

fact that investing in a co-op

where the workers have no obligation to

return anything to an investment about

bad actors you're inventing these things

we were talking about

private investment and worker co-ops you

had made a statement that these somehow

couldn't coexist

i'm explaining to you that there's not

the slightest problem

you want to change the topic that's very

nice but that's what the topic was

we weren't comparing goods and bad

stories we were explaining

how and why private investment is not an

either or

in relationship to work or co-ops the

one of the fastest growing industries

in spain is something called the

mondragon cooperative corporation

it's a family of worker co-ops they're

not even worker management

i don't know if this isn't even a good

it is it is it is the seventh largest

corporation in spain

it's a federation of corporations excuse

me it's a federation of corporations and

it's not even worker managed

that's just worker owned and they have

all the same exploitative problems they

go to south america for labor

they rely on contract labor chomsky's

criticized the mondragon thing for

existing in a capitalist framework

forever

and even if this was your go-to killer

example the mondragon federation of

co-ops exists under a capitalist

framework

could i finish or do you need to tell me

about the mondagon corporation

i didn't mean to interrupt your lecture

i'm sorry continue sure you did

come on who you think you're kidding the

mondegun corporation has

many parts the biggest single part of it

are

a collection of worker co-ops if this

were the united states we'd call it a

holding company

which is a collection of subsidiaries

that do a variety of things

it's very common in the united states

and it is very common

in the world of worker co-ops to do that

as well the different

divisions help each other the co-ops

support one another

that's how the mondragon corporation

went from six people in 1956

to over a hundred thousand now most of

the people

in the mondragon corporation function

within

their members about 200 companies

each of which has workers one person one

vote

making democratic decisions this company

has been extraordinarily successful

it has out-competed its capitalist

competitors that's how it became so

large

that's how it becomes so successful as

it has been

it has rules it maximizes because you

raised that before

a variety of objectives it is not

focused

exclusively on profits the notion that

profit

is the bottom line is the very

convenient

economic nonsense because profits go

into the hands

of the capitalists at the top and of

course they want the company to maximize

profits because that's what they get

they don't maximize wages

because that's what they don't get other

people get that

if the other people ran the business its

objectives would not just be

profit but the well-being of those

workers the community's well-being

a whole lot of other objectives

to maximize and you'd have to choose

among them

you wouldn't have the essential profit

maximizing

which we teach in economics without it

explaining to our students

that by maximizing profit the whole

company's life is devoted

to maximizing the return of a very small

number of people

within it okay this is what has changed

in a worker co-op that's why it's so

different

from capitalism it's decisions

investment

growth distribution of income all the

big decisions

would be made with a different set of

objectives

because a different set of people with

different interests

are making those decisions for a society

like ours

that blabbers on about democracy you'd

think this was the most attractive

possible way to proceed because it

democratizes the economy

by democratizing the enterprises at the

core of that

uh economy instead we live in a society

which pretends that you can have

political democracy even though in

economics you have an

autocracy a tiny aristocracy running

each enterprise doing what it wants

maximizing the part of the output

it gets namely the profit and therefore

we get surprised that our political

democracy doesn't work real well

hello that's because it's trying to sit

on top of an

economic system that is the opposite of

democratic

the proposal of socialists is a proposal

to extend democracy from the political

realm

to the economic realm why that is

frightening to people who otherwise say

they favored democracy i find

amazing i find it equally amazing that

throughout this entire monologue

you're all you're advocating for are

liberal markets with a little bit more

government intervention

if you want to talk about mondrag

absolutely if you want to talk about

mondragon we can talk about mondragon

until we're both blue in the face

one it's not worker managed okay it is

just worker owned a lot of the

management that comes

within a lot of the mondragon federation

come from other workers but they do not

vote on all of their policies or

productions that is absolutely not true

number two mondragon does run itself for

profit that's why if you only change the

means of production and not the mode of

production you are still producing

commodities

for a profit now it happens in this case

that the profit is going to the workers

but it still absolutely runs for a

profit

that's why socialists point to it and

say look at how successful it is part of

the reason why successful is the amazing

revenues and profits that it returns to

workers that are generated and then

number three mondragon in order to

continue to grow in order to continue

growing one of the problems that

mondragon has started to face recently

and it's one of the reasons why it's

criticized by

people like chomsky is because it had to

continue to acquire more and more

workers

that do not get controlling shares that

don't have the ability to vote what's

going on mondragon also trades

across markets including going to places

like south america and trading with

exploited workers

so i don't think that mondrag and

finally mondragon exists

under a capitalist mode of economics

like mondragon exists and interacts with

other people within a capitalist economy

which i think is good

if mondragon works and succeeds that's

awesome i think it's cool i like to see

alternative types of businesses succeed

but i don't understand how you can talk

about the successes of mondragon

and then say that like well this is an

example of the failures of capitalism

when mondragon exists and

thrives right now under a capitalist

framework interacting with so many other

capitalist sections of the economy so

many other capitalist countries in the

world

my problem is that by moving more

towards what you want you would use

government policy to necessarily

disallow

the types of private ownership or

private investment that have been so

important with other types of inventions

around the world you can you can keep

saying that i'm making stuff up but at

the end of the day

the problem that we're having to explain

the problem we're having is i

th the definition of socialism and i

notice that this is like the it seems to

be a key problem with people that

call themselves socialists your

definition of socialism is so amorphous

and morphing at any particular point in

time i

still don't really have you seem to be

having trouble with it but that doesn't

make it amorphous

it absolutely is amorphous even your

definition of capitalism is absolutely

amorphous

um where i i hear rules well you're just

not familiar with it i'm absolutely

familiar with it

like i i absolutely am able to if you

would like to ask me for my definition

of any of these things i would be glad

to explain it and you can tell me you

can correct me professor if you think

i'm incorrect in my understanding of

things

but i believe that when i ask you to

tell me like what is capitalism what is

socialism and it feels like i'm i'm

listening to quebec you know read off

the board in jeopardy i feel like that's

damaging to the position that you're

trying to explain more so than me asking

the question

yeah well let me correct you about

mondragon

that which is by the way how it's

pronounced mondragon has

multiple parts some of the parts are the

adjustments it's made to living in a

capitalist world that's absolutely

correct

that would have to be any worker

richard industries that grew up in

feudalism

oh sorry do you mind repeating that last

line you just cut out there for one

second

right any worker co-op

that forms now has to exist within a

framework of a society that's organized

differently that's exactly the way it

was when capitalism emerged

out of feudalism the early capitalist

enterprises

towns villages had to exist within a

feudal

framework they had to come to terms with

that

some of them were able to do it others

of them disappeared or were overthrown

by feudalism until they got big enough

and strong enough and learned from the

mistakes

of early experiments in capitalism how

to set up a system

that would be what it now is the global

system

i expect the socialists to kind of

replicate that experience

russia was an experiment china's a

better one

cuba vietnam and so on they make efforts

they're learning what you do

what you don't do what you replicate

what you avoid

and they will get eventually to the

scale

and sense of how to do it on a more

global scale

that's how feudalism happened that's how

slavery happened that's how capitalism

happened

and it's reasonable to expect that's how

socialism

will happen there is no simple

definition of

socialism that would be to use your

words correct

no agency gives you out a license this

is correct

that one isn't a tradition

as lively as global as socialism

is always going to have different

interpretations

different definitions that argue with

one another

that's healthy that's normal there's

nothing

fuzzy or amorphous about it the idea

that you can have

one definition is an authoritative

authoritative and authoritarian notion

that there isn't debate

and contestation when there always is

my job was to give you three of the

major definitions

of socialism that contest in the world

today that are widely accepted by

everybody of course not

but those are the ones that are around

and it's reasonable

to talk about the tradition in that way

can you undergo let me finish mondragon

is an experiment a very successful one

you can if you like attribute everything

to capitalism that happens that's good

and attribute everything bad that

happens to the absence of capitalism

this is never interesting and that's

really not very interesting and i'm not

going to

you know i'm not going to get into that

i will tell you it's good because

there's some remarkable things

that mondragon has done along the way

the majority of its workers voted

the following rule the best paid person

in mondragon cannot get more than eight

to nine times what the least best paid

person is this

i've been there i've been there i've

watched it

it's just not true so you're telling me

that of all the employees in mondragon

the highest paid employees that was a

decision

that was a decision made by a large

number of the worker co-ops that make

that

so you're telling me that the highest

paid employee in mondragon

it has a ratio of what they're any of

the let me finish in many of the

component

co-ops there you go okay that's correct

it's a holding company of many many

co-ops

in many many of those co-ops i can't

speak for everyone

this was a common rule i went and spoke

with them

i interrogated them about it

and that's what i discovered they passed

a rule after much debate

that a maximum difference of eight to

one you know that corporate ceos in this

country

get roughly on average 300 times what

the lowest paid worker or even the

average worker in their

uh employee class what is the ratio of

what is the ratio they were able to do

something about

inequality wow here they are

successful in growing they're the

seventh biggest corporation

they're the envy of most other

corporations in europe who cannot

show such a history but they were

concerned

not just to maximize profit but to do

something

like limit the inequality that otherwise

is so corrosive

to societies like ours and they were

able to do that

that's an interesting quality thomas

piketty released a book in 2014

in which he demonstrates in 600 pages

that

every single capitalism we have a record

of

has built into it a tendency to ever

greater inequality that is only

periodically interrupted by revolts from

below

like what we had in the 1930s in this

country which

never are durable because once the

revolt passes

the tendency of capitalism to in

inequality

grows that has always been an

inspiration to socialists

to advocate for a system that might have

within it

a built-in mechanism to at least

reduce the inequality that that

haunts capitalism and

the reality is that mondragon and not

only that

have demonstrated that there is a

quality of worker co-ops

that does and effectively a good job

of addressing the inequality that

otherwise

haunts capitalism and that would be an

interesting

way to understand why socialists

would be drawn they are not worker

managed

the way a corporation works is there are

three layers roughly

the employees who do most of the work

the managers who supervise the employees

and then another group of people to whom

we give the name

directors the board of directors

the shareholders elect the board of

directors because they're the ones who

receive

legally the profits and they decide

what is to be produced how it's to be

produced what technology to use

where the production happens and what is

done with the profits

the managers don't do that so to talk

about

gentlemen gentlemen we're coming up to

we're coming up to the hour now um

we have had uh a disproportionate amount

of talking time i think uh by you

professor wolf while at the same time

uh destiny would you want to give a

closing statement to this as we're

coming up

i'll give you a couple minutes to

respond um i mean i just i take issues

the audience

yeah i mean i just i i man there's so

many things

citing i just think it's incredibly

disingenuous to open with mondragon

has 80 000 employees and they voted to

have an eight to one pay between owners

and and their and their not owners the

highest paid employee and the lowest

paid employee

but that's not true you corrected

yourself after i corrected you which i'm

grateful for it's within

within the co-ops within that federation

i'm willing to be that if i were to ask

you you probably couldn't tell me what

the highest paid employee

within the mondragon federation is what

is the ratio of their pay to the lowest

paid employee of the mondragon

federation

because it has an incredible vertical

structure in terms of how it interacts

with itself

now i could just as easily construct to

a world where the ratio of pay

between the ceo of amazon or walmart is

much is

is much smaller where the ratio uh

closes between the lowest paid employee

if i create a walmart or amazon holding

company

and i simply split off all the

managerial people or some sectors of

that company into their own individual

companies

and break it up like that the way that

mondragon has not to say that mondragon

has failed

not to say that they have totally

different sectors they have i'm not

making this stuff up everybody can go

and look at how the company is

structured everybody

can go and look at the different types

of things they have grocery stores

they've got a financial sector

right all right yes but they do not

separate out their managers they do not

separate out one

group of workers with high pay from

others that's a hustle

that would be i agree it would be a

hospital

is just that's make-believe you know you

acknowledge that the

argument is so difficult that you have

to make up the information to support it

my argument is so concrete that i don't

think i've had to bring up feudalism a

single time to make any of my points or

ask you any questions related to any of

your points

um so something something something i'm

curious about

would why wouldn't you consider just

going by the incredibly generous

definition you give me a point one

social

why wouldn't you consider the democratic

party in the united states a socialist

party

as a party that wants to see more uh

more stuff returned to americans wants

to see people with greater control of

the workplace

um had members that were pushing for 20

ownership in the share of companies

bernie sanders aoc why wouldn't you

consider the democratic party in the

united states a socialist party

because it opposes almost everything you

just mentioned it has a small wing

now that is in favor of it who by the

way call themselves

socialists but the establishment of the

democratic party

its history over the last hundred years

since uh franklin

that's not fair why would we why would

you talk about the history of it that is

that's not relevant because that's

because history is always absolutely not

relevant you've

you've said yourself that the history no

you've said yourself that the way that

we look at socialism today is different

than it was 100 years ago

joseph biden is a product of that

history as he himself says

that party has been unable to make a

government

they couldn't even preserve the level of

government intervention

that was achieved in the 1930s the last

70 years have been a rollback

of the new deal an undoing of it

and that was done as much by the

democratic party as the republicans

they the republicans pushed harder the

democrats could not only not

advance on what was achieved in the

1930s

they couldn't even preserve it that's

why we have an unemployment problem now

and have had a terrible experience i

think we have an unemployment

no absolutely not an unemployment

problem

proposed a jobs program of the federal

government

the way worked so well in the 1930s you

couldn't even have the courage to come

up with

with what was already done it's

been a retreat democratic party has been

a retreat from what it did before

all that aoc and and bernie are trying

to do

is to bring back the little bit of

socialism

that the last 75 years of the democratic

party have been devoted

to getting rid of that's why they're so

embarrassed

these political centrists by the rise of

the left

they thought it was over no

this is an unimaginable analysis of

political parties today in the united

states

i don't think the closed shop policies

that bain are advocating for

represent some walk-back and policies or

i don't think that the democratic party

and the republican party push

equally or even remotely similarly for

the types of economies that they'd like

to see today

um whether or not you have problems with

how the democratic party functions i

don't know if your issues are with the

democratic party or the politicians that

americans elect i know that it's a very

popular pastime among lefties to

demonize the democratic party for not

being able to authoritarianly

or totalitarianly rule the country uh

absent you know the other half of

congress it seems like a lot of people

uh

on the left don't seem to understand how

our government functions i don't know if

that includes you or not

um but yeah i think just given

given we have we have folks like you

that will help us

uh yeah i guess we'll see yes

i mean all i learned the thing that i've

learned the most today i'm happy to see

that the democratic party under

definition one of socialism i guess is

considered

uh at least somewhat of a socialist part

of you as they are uh believers of

enterprise and private capitalists and i

guess

yeah i just spoke against that how you

got out of that

well you started to you you started to

you started to appeal

you started to appeal to things the

democratic parties advocated for or

appealed to a history 100 years back

like okay we've turned we've turned into

a fox news channel let's

let's slow it down we're gonna get right

to the audience q a okay

all right so we have uh we have hundreds

and hundreds of questions unfortunately

we're not gonna get to all of them i'm

gonna try and time

uh both of your responses to about two

minutes so i'll give you like a 10 to 15

second warning when you're coming up to

that

um so the first one is going to you

destiny

what could convince you uh that your

system or your defense of capitalism

is wrong and that socialism is a better

path forward

um i think seeing these things try it on

a smaller level and then having more

success on larger and progressively

larger levels would be convincing

um the thing that oftentimes troubles me

when people advocate for different

economic systems is

uh much like wolfe has done and says

maybe the he won't say he's done this

but the moralizing of like the

relationship between an employee and

employer or the moralizing

of different aspects of who owns the

means of production or or who works in

the means of production

i'm not really interested in the

relationship between a boston worker

what i'm more interested in are the

material conditions of people at the end

of the day

um if different relationships are more

beneficial to growing the economy

rather than shrinking the economy but

producing a quote unquote better

relationship

i'm more in favor of the former than the

latter i like capitalism because i think

that

having private enterprise uh adequately

allocates capital into sectors of the

economy they desperately need that

capital allocated to it

um i understand that uh wolfe is

laughing because he's probably gonna say

something like oh well what about

healthcare and education and i'm so glad

that me and the rest of my liberal and

even neoliberal friends agree

that there are times when the government

can step in and it can alleviate some of

the problems that the free market

doesn't address for instance capitalism

doesn't solve well for things like

health care or education

something that we desperately need to

realize in the united states as we work

to

i guess you could say socialize those

industries which i'm so glad can happen

in a capitalist framework

all right uh professor wolf do you want

to respond to any of that or just get a

direct question

and if you are going to respond i'm

going to keep the timing to the

two-minute window no i

no i think this is rehashing stuff we

went over so

how about another question all right so

for

professor wolf were a state to become

socialists how would it thrive within a

hostile capitalist world without

resorting to the authoritarianism

and imperialism of 20th century

socialism

i find this sort of remarkable these

kinds of questions

imperialism the imperialism that we

study

as people who are interested in this

topic

is a product of capitalism the

subordination of the third world

asia africa and latin america was a

subordination

organized and operated by capitalist

institutions and capitalistically

dominated societies

imperialism serious issue for sure

but it is serious issue that is the

product

and the activity of capitalism

if you would like to talk about things

the soviet union did

and china has done in terms of their

activities

in and around other countries and you

want to apply

the term imperialism

fine you'd have to make some adjustments

because the logic was different

and the outcomes were different and the

scale of it was

utterly different we didn't have the

soviets and the chinese at least not yet

have had not organized world wars to

hold on and to expand

their imperialist empires like world

wars one and two

so it i find the whole question strange

to put forward especially without any uh

explanation

and now to address briefly the question

what a state that became socialist

would do depends on which of the three

basic definitions i offered that state

embraced if it believed that socialism

was what you have in western europe and

scandinavia

that's what it would do it would have no

problem

excuse me oh we got 15 seconds left okay

that's what it would do if it followed

the soviet model that's what it would do

and if it did the kind of thing that i'm

advocating and the socialists like me do

then it would be devoted to changing the

organization of enterprises

democracy

into enterprise inside capitalist

enterprises

okay to destiny do you think that jeff

bezos works hundreds of thousands of

times harder than his workers

why should he be the richest person in

the world um you don't get compensated

based on how hard you work you get

compensated based on the demand for your

particular set of skills

um there's probably less people that can

work in the position that bezos does and

there are people that can work

in any other more entry level position

at amazon

wow okay wait wait do you disagree with

that do you think just as many people

could handle being the ceo of a

multi-billion dollar company as could

handle being somebody that

works in a grocery store or a fast food

restaurant is there a simple yes or no

to that or am i about to get another

lecture

well you don't want an answer you you

want you just want the answer you want

you don't want it in a

form can i get an answer that doesn't

involve feudalism

that's not cute is that what the point

is here

okay

why don't you just let me respond

without coaching me how to do it

can we do that okay i'll give i'll give

i'll give you two minutes i'll go back

we'll go there

fine the the idea

advanced by you earlier

that you don't have one person walk away

with 200 billion dollars roughly the

estimate of businesses worth and the

vast majority of his employees

unable to pay for their kids to go to

college is a distribution

of the profits of that business that

is morally reprehensible

that's how the wealth was accumulated by

the distributions

of share dividends to shares share

expansion and share improvement in value

we have a system that rewards one

person with 200 billion and another one

with thirty thousand dollars

that's a remarkable decision to make in

a community that

calls itself uh democratic or that what

likes to believe

it wants to give people a fair and equal

chance no fairness here no equality

it is revolting to me that anyone

could find this reasonable and to

explain it by saying

there's a demand that's simply what the

corporations

give each other the demand they're the

ones who

create the which they then

fill with themselves because they're the

ones who hire

each other for that job it's a

remarkable

self-serving system where the folks at

the top

give themselves as much as they can

get away with and if it were looked at

that that way

it would not survive 10 minutes wait

what was the original question

wait hold on we were asking we were

asking how we react to that inequality

no the question was why i asked you why

do you think bezos is compensated so

much more than a love like a frontline

employee do you think that

the demand for those talents is equal

between somebody that could be a ceo

versus somebody that could work in a

sense i don't think the demand

for that talent is an explanation of

anything you'd have to explain why the

demand is what it is

who makes the demand sure i can yeah

what we can talk about all of that i

would imagine you as a professor should

know the answer to all these questions

right

who make who where is the demand to

running a multi-billion dollar company

that turns profits for people that i

mean like you can explain all of these

things i don't know why you would

pretend there's not answers you're very

clear

you can you can cast whatever persians

you want on my

qualification i'm not casting any

inspirations on your qualifications

it's disappointing that instead of

getting an actual answer to anything it

was all moralized that's all

we had but okay let's let's see the q a

okay sure

um all right the next the next question

uh i believe goes to

you destiny if you identify as a sock

dem

why is it that you did not publicly

support bernie sanders during his run

um i think that some of what bernie

sanders advocates for

goes in directions that i think would be

detrimental to the economy there were

larger policies that he had i don't know

how i feel necessarily about a national

jobs guarantee i definitely don't like

the push for like nationwide rent

control

um these are just uh certain types of i

don't know the economy can handle like a

15 an hour federal minimum wage

at the at the federal level um there

were just a lot of policies that bernie

sanders pushed for i think at one point

he pushed also for that plan

for twenty percent of every business

would be owned by workers i don't know

how the united states managed that

and then his version of medicare for all

went like more extreme than any other

version of socialized healthcare in the

world

um a lot of these things just pushed it

way too far for me i didn't think they

were politically viable

i would have taken bernie sanders easily

over donald trump or probably a few of

the other democratic candidates but

i just felt like they were better better

middle grounds than what bernie sanders

was pushing for

okay to you professor wolf um what is

the best way to judge

the success of an economic system uh

such as capitalism or socialism

well you know there are many many

dimensions many standards many metrics

that you can use

one of them is economic growth the other

one is the distribution of wealth and

income that the society

and the economic system generate

for me i i'm committed to asking the

question whether the people who do the

work who pour their brains and

their muscles into the production of

goods and services

are or are not entitled to participate

in deciding

how those goods and services are

distributed how the income

if they're sold in markets is

distributed i would like to see human

beings have the right

to participate democratically in the

workplace it is at least as important

as participating democratically in the

residential community

where you live we have the forms in the

latter

and the complete absence of it so for me

a test of an economic system would be

how much

real democratic participation in both

work and residential community life

people are able to have and on that

ground

capitalism falls so far short that it's

an easy choice

okay to destiny uh under the current

conditions of covid and everything

that's happened as

so many people seem to be suffering and

a distratified people between classes

how can you still defend capitalism

i i don't know people seem to i believe

sorry this one is specifically about the

u.s response i think that

yeah sure people like to attribute like

so many strange ills i i noticed um

professor did it earlier when he said

our unemployment is very high right now

like that's a fault of capitalism and

we're just ignoring the worldwide

pandemic that's currently occurring

um i i just there are ways that our

government right now

can respond to the pandemic that don't

require it to be a socialist government

there have been far more left-leaning

governments and other countries that

have failed to respond to the pandemic

you can look across the entirety of

europe for examples of that if you wish

um i just i think that these two things

are totally disassociated from other i

think that it is possible to maintain a

capitalist economy

while also having adequate intervention

from the government to alleviate the

problems that we have with the pandemic

which

we're starting to see under biden

unfortunately it's taken a while but

even under trump we saw things like the

character and whatnot as well

wait wait let him keep speaking he still

has uh oh no sorry i didn't want to

interrupt him during my answer go ahead

professor

yeah i would respond in in two ways

number one

the united states has four percent of

the world's population

and 20 of the world's covet deaths

for a rich country with a well-developed

medical system

that is a systemic failure beyond

all words so for me yeah

this is a problem of a system that could

not prepare itself

properly for a pandemic it knows could

happen

given the one that we had a century ago

and there are many since that time

and it is likewise a system that was not

able to cope

very well with what it was unprepared

for the second and final thing i will

say

is i notice that there are three

governments in the world right now

the united states brazil and india

characterized by right-wing governments

for most of the time of the pandemic

trump here bolsonaro in brazil and modi

in

india their performances these three

countries

of these three right wing super pro

capitalist leaders

are among the worst in the world

more than pretty much every place else

and i think that speaks volumes to

what's at stake

in making this decision between the

pro-capitalist

and the pro-socialists i mean just to be

clear the uk

italy i mean like there are other

countries that did worse in the united

states and then

comparably there are countries that also

did um that's an amazing standard to you

wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

let's finish it

wait just let this knee finish with this

response we'll do it one minute time and

then we'll we can get a response back i

mean like if you want to look at like

the deaths per 1 million population like

a lot of countries around the world drop

the ball on this some did very well

and some of the ones that did very well

are capitalist countries you know places

like south korea that have like heavily

liberalized their economy or bastions of

like capital success have done very very

well when it comes to tracking and

dealing with this

um you know australia new zealand are

capitalist countries and they also did

very well countering this

um places like the united kingdom that

has socialized healthcare that provides

education for its citizens they had a

worth

worse deaths per million than the united

states did um

again i'm not saying that like hooray

capitalism can save us or you know any

of that stuff i'm just saying that how

your country did

i don't think is necessarily reliant on

the uh organization that you have

in your economy i think it's more

important to see what type of action

does your government take

which i don't know maybe wolf has a

definition of socialism where it's

also the government coming in and

intervening for diseases but you know

whether you have all worker co-ops or

all privately uh managed firms i don't

see how that matters when it comes to

how your country addresses

uh coronavirus

[Music]

do you want a one minute response to

that and then we'll move on to the next

question yes okay

at the beginning of this discussion

steve

rattled off about how

socialist societies have never succeeded

so

he generally equated the socialism but

the success

i try to do that now in terms of the

coveted response

and he takes exception he doesn't want

it to be so

he doesn't like the linking of the

social system

with the problem well you really can't

have it both ways

i didn't point out that socialism come

in capitalist countries

had some general difference i pointed

out that the

three of the worst examples of mass

death

happened in societies led by people on

the extreme

right that that leaves a big open space

for the variety of

other less extreme situations

that's the point of it all it's not that

capitalism is the cause of everything

but that it contributes in ways that you

can identify

and trace i i i i

can i get a five

i think that you would have an easier

time blaming chernobyl on socialism than

you would the coronavirus response on

capitalism that's all i'm saying

exactly that's exactly what you're

saying i see that thank you

okay uh can we uh two more questions

gentlemen uh do we have time for that is

that all right i got all the time in the

world

okay uh to professor wolf worker

cooperators survive and thrive all over

the world by the thousands

why couldn't we build a stable

sustainable economy based on the bottom

up democratically when cooperatives

emulate that model here in the u.s why

hasn't it taken it off yet or sorry why

hasn't it taken off yet

well there are many reasons you know

capitalism and i will apologize in

advance for

referring to feudalism and other systems

they not only take a long time to get

going and to settle in

but when they do one of the reasons they

succeed is that they develop

a culture a politics that is consistent

with

that is built so it reinforces the

economic system

upon which it sits capitalism is no

different

if you begin to break down as capitalism

is now doing and you see efforts

whether they work at co-ops socialist

movements uh

labor movements and so on beginning the

construction the slow

construction of alternatives they're

going to encounter

politics and culture that stand in the

way

politics and culture that militate

against it

i can't tell you the number of times i

explain worker co-ops to people

who really can't get their heads at

first around well gee how do they get

money or

how do they solve their problems or how

do they grow

because in their world there has to be a

boss

and the boss has to be in other words

they have adjusted their own life

expectations and understanding of how

the world works

to the way it is now all of that is

breaking down but it takes

time and i think that's why the you'll

see

that while worker co-ops have existed

from the beginning when the united

states was even just a colony

why it takes a long time before the

combination of breakdown of capitalism

and the emergence of these alternatives

gets up to speed so that people's

political and cultural

awarenesses allow them to flourish

all right final question to you destiny

uh why do you never mention vietnam

especially in relationship to

how they handled kovid and their success

in that area

um i don't know specifically why i

looked into um for all of my cover

debates it was usually

new zealand australia south korea

and then on the flip side places like

the united states and the the uk for

examples of successfully handling the

pandemic

versus unsuccessfully handling it um in

terms of uh that that's for the

coronavirus stuff in terms of like

economic history

my understanding is that vietnam tried

the you know their

single party state labor unions kind of

like this under one party they had a

heavily socialized economy

but much like what existed in the ussr

people after their you know work shifts

would have to spend time throughout the

day um engaging with like a shadow

economy or kind of a black economy or a

black market where they would have to

buy and sell the goods that weren't

otherwise

available in their country um in the in

russia they did this with a system or in

the ussr they did this with a system of

blots

um i don't know if they've got a formal

name for it and the vietnamese economy

but it seems like the way that vietnam

has worked to kind of modernize their

economy through i think they're called

the i'm going to butcher that

uh pronunciations like the doi moy

reforms um through all of these

referendums they did in terms of

bringing their economy more in line with

being more successful

these have all involved the

liberalization of their economy the

association with other economies around

the world

and you could even see with some

multilateral trade agreements like the

tpp

outside pressure was actually forcing

vietnam to modernize on some of its

labor rights the socialist party of that

country was not able to do it on its own

it needed some external association

and we can see that within countries

even socialist countries that they still

have massive problems with some of their

populations i mean we can point to the

weaker situation that exists in china as

an example of what is supposedly a

socialist

country having a huge problem dealing

with uh you know uh

equitable shares of how to treat people

within its own borders

all right final question to you uh

professor wolf

uh under your system of worker

cooperatives would i still get my

playstation 5

absolutely you'd have to struggle a

little bit for it you'd have to talk to

your fellow workers you'd have to talk

about the distribution of income

you'd have to compare your desire for

playstation

uh against all the other interests of

all the other people

it wouldn't be something you worked out

on your own with your particular boss

in any way would have to be a democratic

decision you'd have to come to terms

with that the way you do with democratic

decisions

now in our society to the extent uh

that we have them uh and i would like to

add only that

if if steve is interested he could also

look at the experience with covid

uh that the cubans had because it is in

many ways even

better than the ones that the vietnamese

had

uh for the purposes of complete

transparency i'm just going to state

that that last question was actually my

own

and now i will move on to closing

statements uh we'll begin

uh with uh destiny and then we will end

with richard wolff

uh you have three minutes oh geez i

didn't write a closing statement um

so at the end of this i guess my

important takeaway for all of this is i

think that it is crucial

not to moralize our economic systems i

think that when you start to moralize

economic systems what you forget

is that an economic system is merely a

tool um i don't want to ask a question

of like is a hammer good or evil i want

to ask you know like

what is the best type of nail that you

can hit with a particular hammer when

you begin to point out whether or not a

particular economic system is in and of

itself

good or evil then you lose sight of what

economies are supposed to do which is

efficiently allocate capital or natural

resources in ways that make a country as

prosperous as possible

i do agree with richard wolff and

probably with every socialist or every

left-leaning person around the world

that there are a ton of problems that

exist in the western world and we're

specifically in the united states today

relating to things like inequality

social justice

a lack of access to things like health

care or education or

basic things like food stamps or shelter

or um

or other like basic necessities i just

don't see how a socialist society solves

literally any of these things

and i don't feel like i've ever been

given an adequate explanation by any

socialist

for how they would organize their

society usually these arguments are

incredibly amorphous or vague such that

literally everything is socialism like

you can still have private enterprise

and co-ops and the government does some

things and voila that's socialism

which just sounds like liberalism to me

with government intervention which is

liberalism

or they try to make arguments for more

strict forms of socialism

but i think that it's hard to get them

to admit that in those stricter forms of

socialism they would disallow things

like private investment

and i guess it bothers me because so

many innovations and things have existed

only under the framework of capitalism

that

even with public research and public

pushing you weren't able to get for

instance i believe the led was

discovered

um or was invented in russia like 100

years ago

and it wasn't until western private

enterprise took a hold of that invention

and started utilizing it then anybody

was able to actually enjoy the invention

all right thank you and now professor

wolf closing statements your three

minutes

sure i think it's very hard for people

to

break out of the straitjacket that

capitalism having existed for 300 years

imposes on us often unconsciously

often through the medium of our parents

our teachers

and so forth uh i respect that that's

difficult human beings have a hard time

doing that

i'm included but i think that what is

unique here is that all those

problems of american capitalism that

steve just listed

the difference is whether you see those

as distinct problems

that you as a good liberal think that

the government could address

or that some institutional adjustment

could address

people who have looked at the

inequalities the instability the

injustices of capitalism

have tried that for a long time and it

doesn't

work the fact of the matter is we have

more inequality now

than we had 10 40 and 60 years ago

that's the system that we live in it's

as though what the liberal

does is look for every possible

explanation

other than that the basic system is the

problem

and system change is the solution

and one last effort to clarify since it

seems murky

for steve the difference

i advocate is a radical transformation

of the workplace so that the person who

comes to work is no longer

overwhelmingly an employee a drone

told where to sit and what to do with

what machine on what occasion

and then at the end of the day is told

go home what happens to what you helped

to produce

is none of your business that

transforming that

into a collective community that

democratically decides

so that every worker has two job

descriptions

the particular task and your equal

participation

in running designing and organizing the

enterprise

that is a liberation of human capability

it is a transformation

of life from the bottom up and

represents a kind of socialism

which were it to be achieved would be a

control on the government

so it does what the people need and not

get shifted off to other things that

sustain

the state as against the people that's a

lesson

learned from the earlier socialisms that

the newer socialisms

have incorporated the mass of people

will determine

as capitalism especially in the united

states declines

whether when and how to move

forward but the yearning to do better

than we're doing in u.s capitalism

that's already a fact it's now only a

question

where it'll go the very fact that this

conversation is happening

and that someone like me was invited to

participate

is itself a sign of where things are

going

all right thank you so much for

participating in this on both parts

uh would either of you like to plug any

of your current social projects

or what you have going on

um i'm good okay richard

all i would say if anyone is interested

in the kinds of things i have to say

we maintain a website democracy at work

dot info from there you can find

everything that we do

very simple all right thank you so much

thanks everybody

i don't know what to do so i ran into a

similar problem with pogon because

i think that wolf is like relatively

polite

um so i don't want to like cut him off

but like

god damn when he just like

so how do you feel about amazon well you

see

in 1823 when feudalism was a big part of

the catholic church it's like

oh my god stop why are we doing this

how do we define when we talk about what

a what a dog is

we start off by saying that it's not a

cat wait what

there were so many things where i wanted

to i i think i got a little bit more

aggressive towards the end

i was trying to be like more gentle in

the beginning but then it felt like he

was getting like fairly condescending

but i don't want to like i don't want to

cut him off because i don't know if um

i don't know if that's like rude or not

um but then

it felt like yeah i don't know i so i

started to take a few more shots towards

the last half

but i hope i established that it was

because he was kind of starting it i

don't know

um he got super mad right after your

initial statement yeah like right after

my opening he's like uh

socialism is i hate to admit this

i hope my mom's not in chat the the

conservatives were right i guess

socialism to people is just when the

government does stuff i guess

that was definition one um

i didn't get to get to like any of my

five challenges

what level of violence is acceptable for

you to reach a social estate

how do we decide which businesses are

allowed to exist in a socialist society

but it felt like he squirmed around a

lot of these so like when i asked him

because i asked him like so are you

saying that like only

um like only co-ops can exist in the

studies well no but i'd like more co-ops

than private firms because well how do

you enforce that

um oh and another thing that i hit on i

might this might be exclusively how i

debate lefties in the future

um i think i'm just going to talk about

capital markets because i feel like a

lot of people in the left just don't

know anything about the stock market

which is a little bit surprising to me

because if you're going to talk about or

critique capitalism

i feel like private equity markets or

like financial markets or capital

markets i feel like that's really

important to understand

it's like when you say things like well

you know a corporation has no obligation

to return the money to you like wait

what do you mean

why do you think they started paying

ceos in stock

instead of in actual cash we the whole

point of this is because they want

um the quote unquote owners of the

company to be maximizing returns for

shareholders like

i i think i think that i really do feel

like in the future

i think for lefties i think i'm just

going to exclusively say hey let's talk

about the stock market

um most socialists don't understand

materials conditions yeah i just

geez

i felt that he was floundering in terms

of investors yeah and then and then when

he was like well i can point to hundreds

of thousands of examples that doesn't

happen oh yeah i'm sure

i mean look at enron like of course

there are going to be situations where

people [ __ ] each other over yeah of

course

the majority of c-level employees

six-figure bonuses are all locked into

stock for years yeah of course

i think your complaining about feudalism

was bad having a long historical

perspective on different ways of

organizing society seems proper and

relevant

when talking about the possible

evolution from one economic one complex

economics

well so technically oh god i hate to do

this okay

i hate to i hate to debate bro you here

but i'm gonna use one debate bro term

okay

it is fallacious to say that because we

came from one system and we're going

somewhere else

necessarily means we're going to go from

this system to the next and

even if i did grant that causality even

even if i did say because here is the

argument he's making

we went from a to b and then from b to c

and then from c to d

now we're definitely gonna go from d to

e even if i did grant that dde is going

to happen

there's no conclusion there's no reason

to believe that e is socialism

e could just as easily be a fascist

state e could just as easily be a

post-nuclear war a post-apocalyptic

anarcho capitalist anarcho communist

anarcho syndactylus whatever

society right he could be anything right

so that that

whole line of of speaking is hey

i try to avoid debate bro terms and

right but it's fallacious it doesn't

make any sense

um it is a non-sequitur it doesn't

logically follow that because we went

from a to b b to c c to d

therefore we are definitely going to go

from d to e that needs to be

demonstrated

and what e is e could be socialism or

any number

on the any other number of systems that

also needs to be demonstrated that

argument in and of itself is not

compelling sorry [ __ ]

i didn't even get to i didn't get to

address that but um

yeah why did you say history

isn't relevant because i didn't like the

fact that when he was condemning the

actions of the democratic party he

wanted to reach back over a hundred

years and talk about their failures but

when i was trying to get him to tell me

what he believed a socialist country was

or what socialism was

he was like well hold on i'm not going

by marx's definition things are

different now

well hold on if things are going to be

different now for how you define

socialism which by the way that's fair

if you want to use the international

definition now that's fine but you can't

hold the democratic party to account for

things that another democratic party did

100 years ago i don't think that's fair

i don't think you can do that

you have to be consistent in this if you

want to talk about how things are as

they are now that's fine

but if you're if you're um if your

definition of social is going to be so

wide to include private and this is

another thing that bothered me but

i feel like he never actually gave me a

definition of capitalism either

my definition of capitalism or what i

understand capitalism to be

capitalism is when you have private

enterprise meaning you've got people

that can

own companies that don't necessarily

work them and then they interact with

some free market or open market system

that's what

that's how capitalism is it means that i

can go out and buy a business hire other

people to work it and then i can buy and

sell goods on an open market

like that's it that's all that's what

capitalism is but it feels like um

it feels like he wants to like load

things like

capitalism is when the slave and the

master when you have the employee and

the player and the ownership and the

extraction of limits like damn just

let's just like let's just go by

basically so we know what the [ __ ] we're

talking about because

and then his idea of like well i'm not

going to tell you what capitalism is the

way that we work on definitions is by

saying what they're not

and it's like wait what i thought my

jeopardy equip was good do you think it

was good

i'm trying not to i try to do as many

quips but man it felt like he was

getting really angry so i wanted to

i had to start quipping i had to start

equipping he was quipping on me

um yeah [ __ ] i don't know

i you lazyballed that bezos answer you

answered that much better in the past

well i asked the question again he

didn't even

he didn't even remember the question i

hope that stuck with the audience

i don't know if the audience is keeping

track of things as well as i am mentally

i tried to restate it but i asked him

the bezos question and then he talked

for two minutes and i asked him what the

question was and he didn't even remember

and then i had to ask him again and then

he moralized it

he's like wow like jesus

destiny the difference is ontologically

prior to identity but wolf was still

being a dodging dumb [ __ ] okay sure but

we're not having debates on ontology

here okay

i believe that when most people ask like

hey dude

what's that like oh that

well it's not a wall it's not the color

blue um it's not a light

uh it's not an economy it's not like

wait hold on wait we just

tell me what you think this thing what

do you mean like

if we were having like categorical like

discussions or or

or talking about like the nature of

something we were having an ontological

debate

we could do that but that was not the

level of discourse we were at here

that's not what we were talking about

you need to add like 10 more nebraska

steve i tried to get more snarky towards

the end because it felt like

yeah [ __ ] i don't know i feel like this

is going to sound really weird

but i feel like having an unmoderated

in-person debate with him would be a lot

of fun

is he from new york the way that he

talks strikes me as somebody from the

east coast and i i think those

i like people like that because he seems

like he seems like he would be more

combative which would be a lot of fun i

think

um but um yeah [ __ ]

oh massachusetts okay yeah close enough

also destiny why is it wrong in your

opinion to moralize an economic system

sure

so the reason why it's bad to moralize

an economic system

is because people pretend like what we

want exists in the economic system

but that's not true what we want comes

after the economic system

we don't care about what happens within

an economy what we care about is at the

end what the distribution of goods and

services are

so here's an example of this let's say

that we have an economy where the worker

and the owner can only earn two times as

much as each other and everything is

equitably split out and blah blah blah

blah and let's say that society is poor

and starving

would we prefer that or would we prefer

a society with massive inequality where

the poorest people you know can eat

steak dinners every night it's like

right

well okay well obviously we prefer the

latter rather than the former and the

reason why is because we're not really

we shouldn't be moralizing the

relationships that exist within an

economic system we should be looking at

the outcomes that they produce after

economic systems are just tools

that are supposed to be wielded by

policy makers in order to ensure a more

fair distribution at the end of the day

now that being said it might be the case

it might be the case that a socialist

form of organization achieves more

equitable outcomes

however if that is the case we should be

arguing about the outcomes produced by

that system

not the inherent relationships within

that system right

um do you have a preference between a

profitable system with or without any

quality

if you had two separate systems and they

produced the exact same amount of wealth

at the end of the day

then getting one system that is more

equitable within that system would

probably be better it would make things

easier for policy makers right

the content of the relationship implies

something about the outcome missing the

point

no you're wrong you're just wrong i'm

sorry but you're just wrong

isn't half the point of socialism to

actually um create something ethical

inside the system i

removing alienation of workers and such

alienation of workers and all of that

can be achieved within socialism and can

be achieved within capitalism it depends

you can feel alienated in a labor union

you could feel alienated in a private

place to work

there are probably some people that feel

like they have more control over their

job when they work for places like

amazon or facebook where you're given

some degree of freedom or flexibility

over the projects you choose to work on

then there are some people that work

inside labor unions that constantly vote

against what they personally would want

i mean like we can imagine these types

of conditions existing everywhere we can

also imagine we don't have to imagine if

we want to talk historical examples we

can go back to like the 50s and 60s we

can look where labor unions will vote to

disenfranchise minority swathes of their

membership

it took the federal government and the

civil rights age coming in and actually

enforcing externally onto labor unions

worker-controlled unions

um things like equal rights or things

like civil rights because a lot of the

white majority owning people in those

unions the the runners of that union

even with the votes of the minority

black people still weren't able to

achieve equitable conditions for those

black workers

again i'm not blaming the union or the

system capitalism can reinforce racism

uh socialism can reinforce racism

capitalism can also do things reinforce

anti-racism and socialism could

reinforce anti-racism

right now in our society there seems to

be in the past

50 years ago it seems to be the case

that there was a price tag for being

somewhat bigoted for being somewhat

racist

if you made movies or film or if you had

businesses that didn't serve black

people

that didn't showcase uh gay

relationships et cetera et cetera there

was a reward for that in the economy

you're rewarded for being racist you

were rewarded for being homophobic you

were rewarded for being bigoted

nowadays in society it seems as though

that's somewhat flipped now the rewards

exist for being

you know more woke the worker you are as

a company the more you advertise that

sometimes the more money you can make

doing so if you make a hollywood film

today that has more black people more

women you widen your audience right you

widen your markets here look at how

popular like the black panther was

nobody saw that movie earning i think it

grossed over a billion dollars right

um now i'm not saying now to be clear

again

i'm not saying like look capitalism

solved racism all i'm trying to bring

all i wanna

if i can bring anybody on board with

anything at the end of the day

okay if i could bring anybody on board

with anything in the day here is all i

want you to do just stop

thinking of tools as being moral or

immoral

okay there's no reason to assume that by

adding a small amount of your labor to

some capital that you now own that

capital

any more than the capital adding his cap

now the capital is adding his capital

labor owns your labor

right these relationships aren't

inherently moral or immoral we should be

concerned about the material conditions

that exist at the end of the day

okay economies or economic organizations

or economic policies

should only be policies that are wielded

as tools by policymakers

we shouldn't look at these relationships

as inherently moral or immoral we need

to look at the outcomes that these

systems produce

that's all that's all i want to bring

you on board with and if you still think

that like well i think socialism makes

better outcomes than capitalism

okay fine we can argue about that sure

and in some limited cases

you know you might be right or maybe

even a wider case you might be right you

know maybe you can point to

the idea that people getting to vote um

you know when some companies you know

feel you know better about the way that

things run you know my

fiancee's dad in sweden um he lives in

like a uh like a co-op

is like the type of apartment he lives

in my understanding is that those are

pretty popular in sweden

where you move into a building and you

buy a share in that building and then

you live in it you get to vote on like

the changes that happen in that building

and apparently

a lot of people in sweden that really

like that organization you know um you

know and that type of co-op where you

actually control where you live you know

maybe having voting power there is

important maybe i need to choose that

right

all i'm saying is that just don't look

at like these economic tools

which are just tools don't look at them

it's inherently morally immoral because

what happens is

is when it warps your [ __ ] brain it

leads you to saying some things that are

actually

create bad outcomes like something that

you might consider

like a more inherently moral

relationship might get you to a worse

outcome which is something we don't want

right um for instance if we give workers

so like here's

i can give you a hypothetical railroad

example if we give workers autonomy over

their workplace it might be the case

that workers that work in a fossil fuel

industry

will massively vote to overproduce

fossil fuels they might massively

promote

to increase production because they're

protecting their own industry they're

protecting their own jobs

now before somebody says oh well nobody

would ever do that you can look in

places like california

where there are labor unions that

constantly fight against the turning on

of massive solar arrays here because you

know they don't want their jobs to be

threatened you can look at places you

can look at a federation of unions the

largest one in the united states the

afl-cio

you know has a position against the

green new deal because they don't

believe that the green new deal

adequately takes into concerns

uh or takes into its concern the concern

of the workers that exist within their

unions you know

just don't moralize just don't moralize

your economic system it just leads you

to um

it just it poisons your brain it gives

you it it clouds your judgment and it

gives you an inability to

analyze these problems and give you good

prescriptions is my problem

why didn't you open with this moralizing

argument um i tried to but

the problem is that like any time i

asked him any question about anything it

felt like um

i don't i don't feel like my debate

would poke it it felt like he didn't

make like he'd

never wanted to make like a concrete

point or argument it's hard for me to

tell i try to be generous to my

people that i my interlocutors i try to

be generous and say maybe i'm not

understanding something

um maybe i'm just missing something

but i feel like i'm reasonably

intelligent and i feel like i have a

decent grasp of these topics if it feels

like you're dancing around in circles

and it takes you so long to answer any

question

like if i just ask questions like what

is capitalism to you you're like what is

socialism like can you give me and you

have to talk for three minutes and it's

like a 200 year long answer like i don't

know it feels to me like

it feels like a bit of obfuscation is

occurring or rather

like if i i don't want to go the bad

faith route but maybe they do this

unintentionally

what it feels like this is what it feels

like to me it feels like you're scared

of giving me

a concrete definition because you know

that any definition that you give is

going to be inadequate and that you can

be attacked on it

um maybe and maybe i should be maybe i

need to find a way to put me on the

defense more on my things

because the frustrating is if you would

ask me to define anything i tried this

at one point of the debate but then

wolfe ran from it

um it was over the bezos thing i can

tell you exactly why a ceo gets paid

what they do and i can tell you exactly

why

any worker gets paid what they do right

we can talk about like

the marginal cost that the next unit for

the marginal cost of labor going into

the next unit the marginal cost of a

product or we can talk about

supply and demand of different types of

talents in the workplace i can give you

exact answers i don't have to

i don't have to talk for about 200 years

ago you know somebody said this and

that's why i

can give you exactness all of these i

feel like you should be able to do the

same for for any explanation that you're

giving you know

the three card game he played with the

three definitions of socialism was

amazing he claimed that portugal was

socialist so socialism works but he

advocated for the third form not the

first

yeah it reminds me of when unlearning

economics was saying like

oh well 15 an hour minimum wage can be

good here's all these studies that say

twelve dollar minimum age just

minimum wage is possible it's like okay

uh

could you elaborate on why you didn't

consider vietnam's response to covid

um i because i've heard varying things

about like the southeast asian region in

terms of like whether or not they under

report like

because i've heard people claim that

china underreported the amount of

sickness i haven't heard that claim

regarding to vietnam

but i just haven't looked into it enough

and i have other very concrete countries

where i trust the data that comes out of

them

and the three that i typically look at

are south korea and new zealand

australia for like how effective are

lockdowns um and then i'm kind of

familiar with like how western countries

dealt with things um

roughly mainly like the uk and the

united states but i just haven't looked

into vietnam that much in terms of the

i coronavirus like you're saying things

like you may be misunderstanding made

you look bad did i say that a lot during

the debate i tried to cut that

down um because i said that a lot during

pogam i try that to be um

generous to my opponent but i think

rhetorically i don't think it plays well

i tried not to do that as much as i like

oh maybe i don't understand it no i

think i did say it a couple times

yeah i should just i should just not say

that ever because it's

because [ __ ] i feel like i'm i'm trying

to be humble i'm trying to show some

respect

but i really shouldn't uh august pointed

this out what i should be saying instead

of like i don't really understand

what you mean this year you what i

should be saying is you haven't

adequately demonstrated this can you

explain this again that's what i should

be doing

um because that's actually true yeah

i wonder if opening within all socialist

countries have failed put some on the

back foot right again i feel like i have

that several times in my opening

statement but

in the past you've said clearly that

stocks are gambling yet you seem to

define it as specifically receiving ri

you're betting a lot of money on an

individual stock is gambling of course

but that is not at all even remotely

related to anything i've said in this

conversation so i don't know why

also like [ __ ] i dude i should focus on

capital markets

um i see this idiot uh matt cletch or

whatever i see this dumb [ __ ] tweeting

too

um jeff bezos is worth 200 billion

because of his skills well okay

well let's say that instead of jeff

bezos being worth money let's say that

we distribute all of that in stock to

the employees

well what are the employees going to do

with it right they're probably going to

sell the stock

so let's say that the employees sell the

stock to earn some money now instead of

conversation well well now you have a

bunch of employees that work for amazon

that don't own any

stock like you can't get food with stock

let's follow that to its logical

conclusion like what would that even

mean like how would you even like

i don't know or i get well

actually there are answers to this i

don't want to give them though because i

don't think lefties understand capital

markets enough to know what the answers

would be um

rage poke there we can think we could

probably invent some stock schemes to

make it work

so like you would distribute stock and

then you would do a stock split maybe

every two weeks

and then the stock split would be a way

of employees getting paid out and then

you would like combine this with

buybacks strategically in order to

they're like we could probably think of

like complicated stock schemes

in order to do this but like why if you

really want to do this like an employee

could just buy stock with their wage

right like yeah

but i but yeah i don't know [ __ ]

we need to talk about capital markets

way more with lefties because i truly

believe that um

i truly believe that they just don't

understand

anything about capital markets

is there a real reason why bezos having

that much money is bad

um well so to be i know you put money in

quotes him having the money isn't bad or

him having ownership in the company

isn't bad the bad

thing is the unequitable distribution

well no not even really what kind of the

unequitable distribution of wealth of

society

the bad thing is that we have some

people in society that have an immense

amount of wealth

and then we have some people in society

that are immensely [ __ ] if you want to

see things like this play out in the

real world

like go to san francisco it's one of the

most mind-blowing places in the world

you can walk down the street from

businesses

that are worth hundreds of millions of

dollars and see poor people like begging

for food outside of a starbucks

something is like

terminally broken in that system

something is severely [ __ ] there

so when you have some people that seem

to have amassed so much wealth that they

couldn't spend it over the course of a

hundred lifetimes

and then you have other people that are

homeless well it seems like we have a

problem that we have an equity

problem there but hey i mean like these

problems have existed socialist regimes

too you know

soviet soldiers uh soldiers soviet

soldiers

shot ukrainians that were running away

trying to find food so they didn't have

to eat their [ __ ] family members

during the

of demore um china right now is has over

800 000 uyghurs in detention camps

trying to culturally genocide them

um you know vietnam has had its share of

problems under a single-party system

like a ton of like

socialist countries have problems too

and the imperialist thing was so stupid

as well the ussr was an incredibly

imperialist regime

cuba venezuela bolivia like all of these

like socialist countries have also had i

don't know if i'd say balloon but all

these countries have had like severe or

known yeah

have had like severe imperialist things

going on as well like the idea that

imperialism is somehow unique to

capitalists or unique to western

countries

or even a unique like countries have

been imperialists throughout all of

human history like tons of people have

invaded people for natural resources and

et cetera et cetera et cetera and even

mondragon you know relies on contract

labor from south america and from africa

again people have criticized mandarin

for relying on this

one quip that i thought of um that i

didn't say because i feel like it would

have been way too pointed was

when uh when wolf said that world war ii

started because of capitalist powers

what i wanted to chime in there and say

well at least you're consistent about

not wanting the u.s to come in and stop

genocides but i felt like that would

have been

way too i feel like that would have been

way too aggressive so i

held that one back

this is the problem disentangle the

politics from the economics of

capitalism people conflate the two

and he corrected me on this on the

pronunciation of mondragon

yeah and then i i don't know i don't

know if it counted as a rhetorical win

but when

because i got him to say like when a

country calls itself socialist that's

enough and then i'm like well what about

nazi germany and he's like

well no it's like well what do you mean

uh yeah i don't know i should have

cracked it on bezos

overall you're happy with the results of

the debate um yeah i think if i could

have

wished for anything else i think i wish

that lance would have stepped in more

and

forced him to answer questions i really

truly don't believe that

wolfe answered almost anything that i

asked directly

um and it felt weird for me to step in

and interrupt him when we had a

moderator present i don't know if i

would have

um yeah i don't know

lance did start stepping in he stepped

in twice which i was surprised about but

i wish we could have talked about the

boom bust cycle more too there's some i

wish we could have talked about anything

in this conversation

people said that boom bust cycles are

like inherent to capitalism i consider

that a feature instead of a negative

i think that one thing that i i should

have these studies in one hand

um one thing i've read that capitalist

countries are able to do more

effectively than socialist countries is

capitalist countries are really good at

responding to crises

so a crisis happens in a capitalist

country but it doesn't [ __ ] destroy

the capital's country

you have a bust but then you have a boom

again like capitalist countries boom and

bust

but then they rebound right which is

we've seen this happen several times you

know for him to point out like oh well

look at the great depression like oh

it's like oh cool well look where we are

now our country still exists where's the

ussr

you know where are some of these other

socialist regimes that have come and

gone uh throughout history you know our

you know

you failed at destroying wolf to end the

lefty arc every left in the internet

thanks to straight every lefty is always

gonna side with me i don't know where

i'll look to see how i feel like i did

in the middle i feel like my community

which still has a lot of lefty

sympathetic [ __ ] in it things that i

did really well which is good for me

um and then i'll have to try to dig

through discourse i don't know what

forms i'd look at later just to try to

gauge how i feel like i did maybe the

youtube comment section

or something but lefties are brain dead

so they're going to think that anybody

that is on the left automatically wins

anything

do you think saying you shouldn't

moralize your economic system as good

phrasing such warding because people

seem to interpret that as saying you

should be allowed to take your moral

actions again and

uh if somebody wants to talk about more

we can but

it also felt like he didn't really yeah

i think i've said this before he didn't

really engage with any of my points it

was more just he wanted to lecture i

guess but

yeah um

all right i'm going to

um i'm going to unmute doughnuts and

start responding everything david

pakman's community could be slightly

neutral no no no every

moderately left-leaning community on the

internet [ __ ] despises me because i'm

not as cuck socialist

including david pakman's david pakman's

community is pr is

massively over representing like

socialists at least in all their comment

sections other chats

it's insane but even pacman himself has

come out and said there are certain

things that he can't touch or talk about

because

this community is so far left leaning

do you think him not engaging in your

points was more ageism maybe he's used

to more formal structures of debate we

don't really have a back and forth but

you're just kind of lecturing the

audience but

what do you think about albert einstein

being a socialist i don't know is albert

einstein considered an inventor

one distinction that a lot of lefties

seem to have as well because albert

einstein has brought up so much

is there's a huge difference between

creating a theory

and using that theory to create an

applicable product that can be brought

to market

there's a big difference between coming

up with a theory and then coming up with

a product that can be water sold

lefties make this mistake a lot when um

lefties make this mistake a lot when

they talk about like oh well most

medical research is actually publicly

funded

that's great medical research does [ __ ]

all for the average person

what you need is a medical application

we can have all the research in the

world but if you don't actually have a

surgical procedure or a drug or

treatment or therapy then none of that

research means [ __ ] all

what you need at the end of the day and

what usually happens in private

enterprise is some company taking the

research and finding a way to apply it

to some therapy

without the application the research is

meaningless there's a lot of public

research that goes on and it's

incredibly valuable and that's awesome

but the public is not responsible for

bringing drugs to market that is an

incredibly arduous process

to figure out how do you pick winners

and losers which ironically not

ironically

which it actually makes sense is one of

the big problems

with um is one of the big problems with

uh

massively run co-op economies is that

the government

ends up being the one that has to pick

the winners and losers and historically

it's just been really hard to do this

back when yugoslavia was a thing basket

sent me a paper because yugoslavia tried

to do a market socialism thing

and it's a problem that a lot of like

heavily centrally planned economies have

is they can't respond to change as well

because there's so much bureaucracy in

the way

that trying to get like sectors of your

economy to adapt when you're not relying

on market signals is almost impossible

it was an issue in venezuela it was an

incident in yugoslavia before it's

dissolution

um yeah it's just it's just it's but i

mean it makes sense why this would be

the case it's just going to be

like free-flowing capital markets can

just allocate capital to different

sectors so [ __ ] quickly we see this

happen right

you're seeing pretty right and left at

the same time like you want equitable

distribution of resources but you're

against any significant systemic changes

could you

elaborate a bit on your specific qualm

with the form of socialism that richard

wolf advocates for similarly exclusively

democratization workplace because i

don't think that democratizing a

workplace

necessarily makes that workplace better

i think that a lot of lefties

i i just don't i don't believe that's

the case i'm sorry like

i've had work experience before this

jesus [ __ ] i don't want a lot of my

coworkers voting on what the [ __ ]

happened to my particular workplace

uh that might just be me or whatever but

um yeah i don't know i think that there

are cases where democratizing parts of

the workplace can be positive where the

workplace maybe could suit the worker

better

that's awesome but i would like to find

ways to incorporate that in our current

structure rather than

force it to be that like private

investment has disallowed

in some society you know like

people are upset right now because p you

know it's funny because wolfe was so

upset

that the democrats haven't enacted as

much left-leaning policy as they have in

the united states well what is the case

for that right

it's because of the american voter but

now you want the american voter to be in

charge of every single workplace you

want the same people that voted donald

trump into office to also be voting on

whether or not blacks and whites are

treated equally at the worth

of the workplace and you can sit there

and argue well voters are changed

because of corporate control on blah

blah blah blah it's like okay well how

wouldn't that happen in the workplace as

well how do you think that there

wouldn't be people that are wielding

influence to influence but right these

problems are

are endemic to people not endemic to

economic systems

evils like bigotry and slavery and

homophobia and transphobia and all this

stuff these these exist

independent of any economic system they

can exist under capitalism feudalism

socialism

anarchism uh monarchism whatever ism you

want

deadbeat dadaism

can you still be more specific about how

you thought he was moralizing his

position socialism i missed the opening

of the debate

um because the idea that there is an

employee and an employer i don't think

that that relationship is inherently

wrong i don't think that relationship is

inherently immoral and i think to just

moralize it and say you win the argument

because you said that's wrong i don't i

think that has to be demonstrated

we could go back and have a philosophy

debate on that because that's largely a

philosophy

that's wholly a philosophical assertion

but i reject that i i would argue

against it

just because somebody provides you

capital and you add some labor to it

that doesn't give you 100 ownership over

the

drop of labor added to some capital all

of a sudden gives you ownership over the

final product that's produced i would

argue that i would argue that on a

philosophical level

um but i i don't know if lefties have

ever even thought about having those

arguments

um the idea that adding a drop of labor

to or a bit of labor to capital or uh

natural resource

all of a sudden gives you an entitlement

100 to the newly created product

i think is ridiculous just as ridiculous

as saying the capitalist ought to own it


and the laborer gets no pay for it

i don't know i love the socialists using

his academic credentials as it does yeah

i didn't want to

he said it in the earlier part of the

bit if he would have brought that up in

the last part like i teach classes

like i would have reminded him you teach

undergraduate courses occasionally like

that's

like you're basically teaching glorified

high school classes like let's chill on

the [ __ ] credentials bro okay

but but but he brought that up i think

earlier in the debate and i didn't want

to be like super combative about that

you know

he was wrong about democrats not making

progress after the 30s you could have

brought up on medicare medicaid civil

rights were all passed in the 60s

section 8 was passed in 74.

your own income tax rate was 75 oh sure

yeah [ __ ] there there were like so many

different things that i wanted to but

the problem is we couldn't settle on any

issue i tried to say in the beginning

can we just go point by point but i

don't think it's stuck

um the problem is like any question i

would ask you'd say like point a b

c d e f g and i'm like well okay let's

talk about point a oh thanks

let's talk a little bit about point a

and then he'd be like oh okay well let

me respond to a

one two three four five six seven eight

nine ten it's like wait okay well let's

talk about a1

and he'd be like oh okay so a1 xyz

i was like [ __ ] me dude like right it's

just like i don't want to call i don't

want to use a debate bro term right but

it is a little gish galloping i can't

respond to every single point because

when i ask for clarification on one

thing we have to talk about 35 other

things

you know which damages my it gives it

makes him look more authoritative in the

conversation

in his three definitions of socialism it

sounded like anything that isn't and cap

is socialism yeah

that first definition of socialism that

he gave was so unbelievably wide

thanks it's like well [ __ ] me like what

am i

i mean like your definition of socialism

includes private enterprise

wait what the [ __ ] is this what the f

how the [ __ ] am i supposed to argue with

that your private enterprise

and your socialism wait what the [ __ ]

you have owners and employees i don't

even know what the [ __ ] i'm supposed to

say

to that like what the [ __ ] like you you

win you like auto won the debate

like everything is socialism basically

ah

do socialist economies have debt markets

um

yeah i think i read about this on the

venezuela example and the paper boss get

linked me uh

they have debt markets but those debt

markets are also oh what [ __ ] what was i

um what was i reading was it the eel

lecture we listened to

the interesting problem that you run

into with debt markets

is that a co-op could theoretically make

itself out to be um could make itself

out to be

like a like a capitalist structure

um hold on i'm trying to see where i

read this

[ __ ] i don't remember where i read this

um the summary of this is basically

let's say that you have one co-op that

runs a grocery store and then another

co-op that runs banks

let's say that you go to the bank co-op

you're like hey we need to get you know

a loan for our business because we want

to buy more buildings or whatever

then that co-op can essentially say like

oh sure well we're going to own part of

your business

if you do it or you're going to owe us

part of the what you produce you're

going to get royalties or something like

oh okay

well now you've just recreated

capitalism with more steps now you have

an owner class the bank that bank co-op

becomes the owners of part of the

business of the uh of the employee-owned

co-op right

that is now has part employee ownership

[ __ ] i wish i could just talk about

capital markets for like 10 minutes with

a lefty because i feel like wolf was

just totally like

absolutely like like the reality is

let me explain this real quick okay in

case you guys didn't understand this so

some of you um yeah maybe maybe

some of you guys don't understand this

if i invest in a company

i have part ownership in that company

and there are other investors in that

company

when that company makes decisions it

should be making decisions for the

benefit of its investors it has a

fiduciary responsibility

why is that the reason why that is is

because if it didn't have that

responsibility to outside investors or

shareholders

the problem is that they could just [ __ ]

off with all the money and say [ __ ] it

right

so here's the problem let's say there's

a 100 employee company and let's say

that this company wants to raise a [ __ ]

ton of money for expansion let's say

that i can say oh okay i'll donate

i'll uh i'll invest 10 million dollars

in your company's like oh really okay

well you get non-controlling shares

we'll give you 20 we're doing our

valuation you get 20

non-controlling shares there you go now

you own 20 of our co-op oh cool

then let's say the cop is like hey guys

we just got all this money

uh we're literally not expanding [ __ ]

all we're just gonna pay 80

out um to all of the employees in in the

form of like wages or whatever like

get [ __ ] well as a private capital

investor now you're like

oh well [ __ ] me i guess like

why the [ __ ] would you ever invest into

a co-op that gives you non-controlling

shares

why would you ever do that you're like i

don't want to do that i'm only going to

invest in companies that guarantee a

return

or that should be making a good faith

effort to provide a return to people

that are shareholders

like he kept saying that you were making

[ __ ] up yeah i know he started making

sure but this underlies every single

capital investment in all of

a capitalist society you have to be

otherwise nobody would invest in any

project ever because people just take

your money and run with it and when

people takes your money take your money

and run with it they usually get [ __ ]

prosecuted by the government you gotta

let it do that look what i'm gonna

[ __ ] march

when i'm gonna end run when you commit

fraud like that and you steal people's

money you get [ __ ] for it you're not

allowed to do that

um yeah

[ __ ]

wait so how do co-ops exist now co-ops

exist now

but a big problem with co-ops which i

acknowledged

exists in which everybody should a big

problem with co-ops is directly related

to the problem that i'm giving

and the problem is that co-ops have a

hard time raising capital because who

the [ __ ] is going to invest in a co-op

now there are some forms of investment

where i'll give you this much money and

you give me a royalty like on future

sales or something you can do that

but equity problems or cap initial

capital funding problems for

um co-ops are a big deal it's hard it's

really hard to start a club if i want to

start a business

i've got to find 10 other people that

have a [ __ ] ton of money that are all

willing to come in evenly with me or

somewhat evenly so that we can like

start a business together because

raising outside capital is so [ __ ]

hard

with uh with co-ops it's a problem that

they face it's not that's not like

something i invented like you can you

can go read up like co-op problems and

um capital issues are one of the first

things that comes up

why are co-ops not good options for

investors

because a co-op is owned by the workers

so the co-op is going to be maximizing

returns and profits for the workers i

don't want to buy into that as an

investor

because if i'm not a worker there i have

no guarantee that you're going to return

any profit to me

i invested in a co-op and got fresh eggs

every morning in return

there's no guarantee regardless of what

you're investing in for a privately held

company that it has

like shareholders there's they're

supposed to make a good faith effort to

return money to you

because that's where the decision making

comes from like the board of directors

and everything right

for a co-op it's just workers voting on

things

the owned by workers definition of

co-ops is not what both says right he

just cares about workers control i mean

it's the same thing i mean he dances

around it it's hard to get him to commit

to like any particular thing

i don't know

[ __ ] i should be eating this in my hands

why did he argue that not all co-ops are

worker owned um

because like i don't know because

everything could because his system was

ultimately flexible

i felt like he was saying that a cop

doesn't have to be owned 100 of the

workers

a socialist economy could have private

investment in enterprise

like we don't necessarily need the

government to disa lot like i don't know

just like

basically socialism was everything like

that's what it that's what it felt like

yeah i don't know [ __ ] it

also i feel like i didn't respond

adequately to my because i looked up

mom

china has hasn't had an explosion of

growth

in terms of their um like gdp per capita

sure but when did that growth happen

china gdp per capita history china

opened itself up to massive foreign

investment

in like the 90s

when do we see the explosion of growth

right

it doesn't happen until um

i don't know how far back i can get this

graph to go but this [ __ ] is [ __ ]

flatlined sometimes

negative right it seems like it wasn't

until it started to open itself up to

massive foreign investment and it

started to liberalize its economy more

that all of a sudden china saw these

massive growths in gdp

that's what i saw right also i [ __ ] i'm

not 100 sure this i wish i um

my understanding is that japan uh

japan's growth was superior to that of

russia or the ussr

[ __ ] i need to go and look that up at

some point you give socialism credit for

that though yeah but it wasn't until

they

liberalized their economy that i don't

know the foreign direct investment the

fdi for china has been like a massive

driver of its growth i don't think

anybody

he also said that they invested because

china had an educated population even

though

half the country couldn't read in the

80s oh yeah and then him trying to say

that like

people went to china because of like a

cheap labor for dude that almost sounded

like a self-owned

but i didn't get to push him because he

went on for like 12 minutes he was like

no that's not true people actually

wanted to come to china because there's

a lot of people willing to work for

cheap like

what how is this is that are you

supporting your argument or my are you

basically saying that other countries go

to china and exploit their labor force

and that's like a big win for china [ __ ]

but [ __ ] me whatever

oh yeah eric the trade relationships

helped a lot as well when china began to

take its foreign trade more seriously

for sure

dsp got unpartnered oh no

uh oh

oh [ __ ] stocked unless twitter

following who's not impressed with

wolves performance

these are the types of comments that i

look for to know that i did

very well when somebody says it was a

deeply unsatisfying debate i don't think

destiny comes out of this looking better

but i thought wolf didn't really look

good when i see comments like that made

by people that i know

[ __ ] hate me then i usually feel like

oh okay i think i did

i probably did really well in this

conversation that's usually like because

i'll see the types of things on like um

4chan

where people will be like even though

destiny is like a bisexual cuck

whatever like words people call me like

i think that this wasn't the best

showing for lauren southern or sorry

when i read comments like that usually i

know that the conversation went really

well for me

does sdl hate you no i think me and

stockton left are good his community

hates me though

every single left-leaning community

[ __ ] hates me there's not a single

exception to that

on the internet unironically i'm not

even being hyperbolic

i feel like lance asked him that

question and what wolf was supposed to

say well of course you'd have your ps5s

and your other luxury goods and any

socialist society

all of the workers would collectively be

agreeing to make these goods and

services for one another the difference

is

is that when we produce ps5s the average

worker is the one that's getting

rewarded for that not some technocratic

bureaucratic person way at the end some

owner-class person

at the end of the line i feel like that

was supposed to be wolves answer so of

course you get your goods and services

but now when you buy a ps5 you know that

money is going into the hands of the

workers that made it

not some not some owner that's way past

the line of not even having to do

anything with the production of it i

feel like that was the answer he's

supposed to give

but then he was like well i don't know

you'd have to go debate your worker into

going to

to work to make one for you overall i

think your interruptions of wolf were

kind of annoying

just comes off as needlessly aggressive

but i agree that

moralizing socialism is stupid they

can't

or don't know how to make economic

arguments so they default to capitalism

bad

i felt like i had to interrupt because

he was like he was going on for so

long like i was getting gish gallop so

[ __ ] hard he would bring up like 30

things

i'm sorry i interrupted the donut like

holy [ __ ] i was getting steamrolled

and then he was trying to interrupt me

what i was trying to answer [ __ ]

don't feel bad destiny this was not a

debate

he just rambled and ignored your points

you sort of gave up by the end so it

came off as you accepting defeat

so he came across as the winner without

making any concrete points

uh i don't know about that yeah wolf was

speaking during my closing statement

true

um do you think referring to him as

professors a little past progressive

um i tried not to actually i i

maybe i should have i should have

actually no i should have asked at the

beginning i thought that you were

supposed to refer to a professor as

professor

um like i don't know i can't call him

richard

and addressing him as mr wolfe i think

sounds also

um kind of weird i thought i thought it

was like professor the professor

i thought that's like how you're

supposed to like unironically how you're

supposed to refer to somebody that has a

phd

that's my understanding i don't know how

else i would um

would refer to him as getting him into

exchanges where he is forced to actually

address what you say without lecturing

for minutes at a time is much better

conversation

then he talks to you instead of lectures

if you slash

yeah that's what i try to do but i don't

think we ever got to do that it's really

really hard i had the same problem with

the pogen guy

we're like can we just have like a

real-life conversation where we go back

and forth and get to the bottom of this

particular thing rather than it feeling

like i'm on a prime case panel

where every person just wants to come on

and like give like their four-minute

monologue and not respond to anything

other person said

i wish that uh i wish that he would have

i wish that we could have gone back and

forth on a point more concretely

i think that rhetorically i think i was

relatively effective i don't think he

brought up anything that i wasn't ready

to respond to like i didn't get

blindsided from anything

um i think that was just a matter a

matter of like managing the conversation

uh i think that there were some things

that sucked but i don't know like

reasonably what was in my power to do

things about

um like when somebody wants to ramble

that much and there's a moderator

present doesn't stop

i don't know what i can do in that case

um i tried to hold him down to an answer

but i don't think we ever

got there we what did we go back and

forth we went back and forth on

something oh we didn't have a response

to it i don't know if that landed

well that um like i'm more

what did i say i'm more comfortable

blaming chernobyl on socialism than i am

blaming the coronavis pandemic on

capitalism

he didn't have any response to that and

i feel like if he would have had a

strong response that i feel like he

would have cut in and given one can you

clarify the japan vs ussr growth

rebuttal you made

uh i don't think that the massive growth

of the ussr came under the soviet union

but i'm not 100 i didn't know i didn't

know he's going to defend the soviet

union so much i thought he largely

disowns the soviet union [ __ ]

because usually i think what we heard

him in the base he's like he's just like

oh i'm not talking about the soviet

union i don't think we heard him defend

the soviet union so much

my understanding is that japan had more

growth um over the soviet union the

soviet union did

um and then [ __ ] and then i've heard

like i've got like collections of facts

but i haven't put them all together

because i just don't know much about

like the history like the founding of

the soviet new river

um the cheshire uh cat guy diamond he

said russia was europe's third largest

economy behind britain and germany by

the year 1913.

um france was poorer than the soviet

union as was the dutch republic and

belgium all of which manage not to

masturbate to their own populations with

poor economic planning

so yeah [ __ ] i i just i don't know the

comparative conditions in the early

early 1900s across europe

to compare to the start of the ussr um

but after this disappointing showing

from wolff you should definitely debate

david friedman

he would give definitions cogent

arguments and be much more charitable in

general

i know you don't want to debate in caps

but you should give it a shot

okay destiny why aren't more people just

social democrats

it seems most people rightfully take

issue with exploitation but you don't

need to be a socialist and abolish

capitalism to fix

the problem remember to hit that like

and subscribe and don't forget the

notification bell so that my videos show
