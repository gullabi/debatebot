1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:06,000
okay in the three minutes i have

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,919
i cannot speak as fast as you just did

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
so i won't even try

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,440
i'll try to make a couple of basic

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,679
points

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,280
every economic system in the history of

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,119
the world

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,320
displays the following pattern is born

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,160
it evolves over time and then it dies

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,439
and passes away

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,760
giving way to another one and part of

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,399
that process has always been

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,239
the conviction of the people in each

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,200
economic system

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,239
that sooner or later they can they

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,680
should

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,600
and they will do better overcome some of

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,800
the problems and difficulties they're

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,320
facing

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:52,000
and organize a system that better meets

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,680
human needs the process is sometimes

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,079
relatively smooth other times it's rocky

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,760
that varies with the conditions and

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,960
particularly with the level of

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,080
resistance

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,680
from those who don't want to see the

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,119
system change

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:13,119
and shift capitalism in my

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:16,000
judgment has been born most would agree

30
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,799
has evolved over the last three

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,400
centuries

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:24,320
or so and is now at that last

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,600
stage the only question now is exactly

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,720
how and when the passing

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,840
occurs likewise

36
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,960
in my judgment the yearning for

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,159
something better

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,200
has built up in capitalism

39
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,200
to a pretty intense level now

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,240
whether you look at the debts of

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,799
students

42
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,079
whether you look at the mind-bending

43
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,119
inequality

44
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,000
that this system generates over and over

45
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,119
again

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
unless and until it is revolted against

47
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,880
by masses of people who do something

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,759
about the inequality only to discover

49
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,680
that as long as capitalism remains the

50
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,440
tendency to inequality

51
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,480
resumes i think people are also tired

52
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,200
of the instability every four to seven

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,319
years

54
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,599
capitalism crashes we've had three

55
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,319
in this new century in its 20 years

56
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,840
yup right on schedule every four to

57
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,319
seven years

58
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,280
millions lose their jobs businesses go

59
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,200
belly up

60
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,360
cities and towns can't get the revenue

61
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,519
they need to provide the services

62
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,640
we depend on one sign of the exhaustion

63
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,599
of this system

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,879
a level of money creation a level of

65
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,440
debt creation

66
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,640
we have never seen government debt

67
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,239
corporate debt

68
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,200
personal debt the system is exhausted

69
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,840
and the entire private enterprise system

70
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,959
is now

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,720
on 24 7 government life

72
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,920
support i think it's over i think that's

73
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,080
difficult for us all to live through

74
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,680
and we better learn some lessons from

75
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,080
the british empire

76
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,040
from which they have been tumbling for a

77
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,360
century

78
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,480
we could and should do better on the

79
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,959
downswing

80
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,640
than the british have been able to and

81
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,080
the more we talk about it

82
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,440
and discuss it and explore it the better

83
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,799
our chances

84
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,319
to make another progressive transition

85
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,959
to a better system that we all need and

86
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,000
will

87
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,560
benefit from

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,159
okay destiny are you keeping us on a

89
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,760
timer

90
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,040
i am all right as of march 2021

91
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,159
americans rank the economy

92
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,840
job markets the handling of the

93
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,200
coronavirus and leadership in washington

94
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,680
as the four most important challenges

95
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,920
facing

96
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,599
our country socialist policies would not

97
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,959
alleviate any of these concerns

98
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,480
countries have tried the socialist

99
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,200
experiment time and time again this has

100
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,799
failed

101
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,239
doctors in cuba moonlight is taxi

102
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,519
drivers countries with socialized health

103
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,280
care haven't fared much better than the

104
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,959
us and their handling of the coronavirus

105
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,400
and any socialist regime will

106
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,080
necessarily involve the bureaucracy of

107
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,879
washington even more heavily in our

108
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
economy

109
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,680
any country that has attempted to

110
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,200
realize a fully socialist economy has

111
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,319
either failed completely such as in the

112
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,239
case of the ossr

113
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,159
destroyed large swaths of their economy

114
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,519
such as in venezuela or been forced to

115
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,120
embrace more neoliberal economic

116
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,759
policies to realize true growth in their

117
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,160
economy

118
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,600
such as in china or vietnam liberal

119
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,120
market policies work better in both

120
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,639
theory and practice when it comes to

121
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,440
efficiently allocating resources to

122
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,040
maximizing

123
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,320
the economic productivity of any country

124
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,960
and we've seen this play out time and

125
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,400
time again

126
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,000
across a wide variety of markets and

127
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,720
countries throughout history across the

128
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,400
globe

129
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,759
oftentimes people like richard wolff

130
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,880
will bring up the boom bust cycle as

131
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,560
though it's an inherent flaw of

132
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,080
capitalism but i believe i speak for

133
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,080
most when i say that a boom bust cycle

134
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,600
is preferable to just going bust as so

135
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,880
many socialist countries have

136
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,800
it's also important for us to realize

137
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,240
that no economic organization is in and

138
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,919
of itself inherently more

139
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,600
immoral but rather we ought to view them

140
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,479
as tools to effect some greater output

141
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,919
for our country

142
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,199
that we can later utilize and distribute

143
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,440
in the most fair manner with government

144
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,000
policy to most of our citizens as we see

145
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,080
fit

146
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,840
creating a bigger a bigger pie so to

147
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,680
speak from which all of us can eat

148
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,360
morality and justice should exist in the

149
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,120
realm of government policy we cannot

150
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,320
allow it to blind us to the economic

151
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,000
realities surrounding us

152
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,600
no matter how much we wish a wild lion

153
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,360
not to eat us our desire alone will

154
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,880
never satiate its appetite

155
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,240
while socialism may sound good in theory

156
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,360
the destruction would rot on the wealth

157
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,560
of our country and the oppressive

158
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,680
restrictions it would place on our

159
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,960
businesses would not help the vast

160
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,560
majority of americans

161
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,240
be foolish to enforce protectionists or

162
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,000
socialist policies on our economy while

163
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,440
major developing economies such as india

164
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,440
and china are moving in the exact

165
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,720
opposite direction having realized time

166
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,000
and time again the failures and

167
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,759
socialist planning

168
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,199
socialism implies two major things a

169
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,320
change in both the means and mode of

170
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,440
production the means of production

171
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,199
change in such a way to completely

172
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,400
disallow private investment or ownership

173
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,759
and a change in the mode of production

174
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,120
such that we no longer produce goods and

175
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,639
services for a profit

176
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,240
instead businesses are only started with

177
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,600
the approval of some governmental body

178
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,120
some kind of central planning with the

179
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,400
equal decision making and management of

180
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,680
every worker and the goods and services

181
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,280
produced in any society

182
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,280
are what some government body dictates

183
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,039
irrespective of market forces or the

184
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,400
wants and desires of the citizens

185
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,600
it's likely in the course of this debate

186
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,600
that my opponent will suggest we take

187
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,800
after nordic or western european country

188
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,479
setting that things like socialized

189
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,840
health care or subsidized education or

190
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,680
powerful programs that address many of

191
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,960
the underserved needs of americans today

192
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,080
while this is true i would like to

193
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,520
remind everyone that we've spent the

194
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,039
last decade reminding conservatives that

195
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,360
the government simply providing welfare

196
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,520
has

197
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,960
absolutely nothing to do with socialism

198
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,319
my opponent believes that strong social

199
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,440
safety nets and welfare programs are

200
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,560
important parts of the government

201
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,720
most liberals would welcome him with

202
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,080
open arms me included consequential

203
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,520
there are five major hurdles that no

204
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,720
socialist i've ever spoken to is

205
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,360
adequately addressed and they are as

206
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,039
follows

207
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,639
number one what level of violence is

208
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,280
acceptable for you to reach our social

209
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,720
estate

210
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,160
number two how do we decide which

211
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,520
businesses are allowed to exist in a

212
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,960
socialist society without allowing

213
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,400
private capital investment

214
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,840
three is any form of investment

215
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,600
whatsoever allowed in a socialist

216
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,199
society for an expansion of business

217
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,360
four how are labor markets determined in

218
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,720
a socialist society and five how do we

219
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,080
calculate which goods and services a

220
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,440
nation needs if we do away with the

221
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,880
commodity form

222
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,120
those are my five cool all right so

223
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,919
we're gonna do the open format now for

224
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,400
the next hour

225
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,479
um i don't think i'm gonna need to

226
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,800
moderate too much as long as both of you

227
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,160
just

228
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,919
say something and allow the other person

229
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,720
to speak and don't talk over each other

230
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,080
it should be fine

231
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,880
so uh i guess begin uh now

232
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,520
where do you want to start well let me

233
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,560
let my

234
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:19,520
can i respond to what was said yeah

235
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,440
um i find this a laughable caricature of

236
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,039
anything i've ever written or anything

237
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,280
that i understand

238
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,479
uh is part of this conversation and i

239
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,199
don't appreciate

240
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,080
being told what i think or what i say or

241
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,880
what i mean

242
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,960
or what i intend i can speak for myself

243
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,919
and that would just be fine if we could

244
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,960
allow each other to do that number one

245
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,080
number two

246
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,039
i have no idea what this silly remark

247
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,800
that i hear so

248
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:49,599
often is that no socialist society

249
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,280
has succeeded at anything i have no idea

250
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,520
what you're talking about

251
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,759
let me give you an example one of the

252
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,280
most important metrics used in the

253
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,160
economics profession

254
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,120
around the world to assess the

255
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,240
quote-unquote

256
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,840
success of an economic system is the

257
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,440
rate of economic

258
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,800
growth you measure gdp and you look at

259
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,000
how it grows

260
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,759
over time and then you compare one

261
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,960
country to another

262
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,680
to assess their relative success

263
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,960
not as societies because that's a vague

264
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,360
generality

265
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,039
but at this particular metric which we

266
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,639
use in economics

267
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,800
to measure economic growth over time

268
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,240
it's not the only metric but it's a

269
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,599
widely used one

270
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,800
so i'm now going to use it in the 20th

271
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,080
century

272
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,560
the fastest growing metric the fastest

273
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,920
growing

274
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:49,279
gdp in any country measured

275
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:52,880
was the soviet union and in the

276
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,640
21st century we're living in the fastest

277
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,360
growing gdp

278
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,399
in the world has been the people's

279
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,440
republic of

280
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,399
china this is not an endorsement of one

281
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,080
or another

282
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:09,279
economic system it's a statement of fact

283
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,320
verified by any reliable

284
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,160
source of information the un

285
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,680
the project in the university of

286
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,440
california berkeley and

287
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:22,240
others who keep track of this

288
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,440
so this has to be understood because in

289
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,480
much of the world

290
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,600
economic growth is a shared

291
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,959
objective and goal that these two

292
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,800
societies have

293
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:38,480
excelled at achieving number one

294
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,000
number two when it comes to socialism it

295
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,680
would be useful

296
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,440
if we all understood what the word means

297
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,800
rather than playing around with

298
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,480
caricatures

299
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:53,760
for example the notion that socialism is

300
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,920
all about what the government does

301
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,959
has been contested throughout the

302
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,480
history of

303
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:03,519
socialism and that idea is less

304
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,760
dominant within the socialist tradition

305
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,800
now than it ever was over the last 150

306
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,680
years

307
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,480
for example today one of the most

308
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,000
important

309
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,480
issues for socialists has to do

310
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,560
not with government regulation not with

311
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,360
government owning and operating

312
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,600
businesses not with these bugaboos of

313
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,040
bureaucracy and all the rest of it

314
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,440
but has to do with an objective of

315
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,720
transforming

316
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,600
the organization of production in a

317
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,720
factory in an

318
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,680
office in a store not to have a small

319
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,560
group of people the owner the board of

320
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,600
directors

321
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,839
the tiny little minority at the top that

322
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,880
is a dictatorial power

323
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,959
inside an enterprise making all the key

324
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,800
decisions that the employees

325
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,120
have to live with even though the

326
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,800
minority making those decisions

327
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,760
is not accountable to those employees

328
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,480
that's a socialism of transformation at

329
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,920
the micro

330
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,440
level about which very little could have

331
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,399
been discerned

332
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,480
in the comments preceding these if we're

333
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,200
going to talk about socialism

334
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,079
then we have to talk about what it means

335
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,959
to the people

336
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,600
pushing for it and urging it and those

337
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,360
people have

338
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,200
learned from the 20th and 21st century

339
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,360
just like those who pushed for

340
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,320
capitalism three centuries ago

341
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,399
learned from their early experiments how

342
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,880
to refine how to adjust

343
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,000
and how to change to pretend that that

344
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,200
didn't happen

345
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,440
to trade in old and shrinking

346
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,240
conceptions of socialism

347
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,920
may be good debating ploy but it doesn't

348
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,040
advance our understanding

349
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,760
of anything um okay if you want to be

350
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,680
easier to have a

351
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,880
more of a back and forth rather than um

352
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,160
the super long

353
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,079
monologues so we can respond each other

354
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,920
more if you're okay with that um

355
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,000
just for for a couple of things you said

356
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,160
so i'm trying not to miss you

357
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,120
i just talked slower than you oh yeah no

358
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,040
it's fine it's fine

359
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,560
um my understanding is that um in the

360
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,800
20th century there was a faster growing

361
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,560
economy than the ussr and it was japan

362
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,800
japan still exists today and the ussr

363
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,040
does not i understand that the ussr

364
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,560
did show a huge amount of growth but i

365
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,079
think it's odd to use that

366
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,800
as an example when socialists often

367
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,480
point to the evils of imperialism

368
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,160
and when you point out the fact that

369
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,360
everybody was heavily industrializing

370
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,200
around that time as well i don't think

371
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,279
it's fair to say that the ussr simply

372
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,480
grew on the merits of socialism

373
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,760
uh when there were so many other things

374
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,279
happening at the time and when it was

375
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,240
outgrown by another economy that was

376
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,000
but those are those are the facts i mean

377
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,639
you can play whatever games you want

378
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,279
the fact of the matter is that the

379
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,160
soviet union's performance in the 20th

380
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,959
century

381
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,639
completely outshines that of japan

382
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,760
there's no comparison

383
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,399
in 1917 when the soviet union begins

384
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,519
it is the poorest country in europe by

385
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,519
far

386
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:03,360
it then goes through 70 years of a lost

387
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,920
world war one of a civil war

388
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,800
of an agricultural collectivization and

389
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,040
of world war

390
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,639
ii which did more damage in russia than

391
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,600
in any other country

392
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,600
none notwithstanding that it was the

393
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,040
poorest country at the beginning of this

394
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,279
horrific story

395
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,600
it ends up in 1965 being the number one

396
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,120
competitor of the united states for

397
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,320
global hegemony

398
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,920
that's only because of its

399
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:35,200
number one status in economic growth

400
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:38,959
that achieved the overcoming of all

401
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,880
those horrific losses i'm not arguing in

402
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,600
favor of this or that about the soviet

403
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,800
union

404
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,600
but the fact of its achievement

405
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,000
is a staggering reality that you can

406
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,000
dance

407
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,040
around from here to tomorrow but it

408
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,920
doesn't go away

409
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,160
because it's inconvenient to confront it

410
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,279
and the same thing is true now

411
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,360
if you read pearl box novels about china

412
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,720
before the revolution you will hear

413
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,000
about a society

414
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,120
whose depth of poverty literally blows

415
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,600
your mind

416
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,839
and here they are about to surpass the

417
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,720
united states before the end of this

418
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,440
decade

419
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,560
and that was accomplished by a communist

420
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,959
revolution

421
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,839
and a government that has been run by a

422
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,440
communist

423
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,320
party to this day and yeah

424
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,199
for sure they cleverly opened their

425
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,399
society

426
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:33,199
up to capitalists to come and join them

427
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,680
but to imagine that the achievement of

428
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,519
the

429
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:40,480
chinese economy is purely due

430
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,320
to the private capitalists rather than

431
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,959
to the state

432
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,560
economy that's making believe because

433
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,880
you need to have an argument

434
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,320
that puts the success at the credit of

435
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,480
one or the other

436
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,680
the infrastructure the training of the

437
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,920
mass of people

438
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,199
everything that happened in china is as

439
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,760
much a product

440
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,519
of the planning and policies of the

441
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,399
communist government than of any other

442
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,959
factor

443
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,720
and that has to be recognized as well

444
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,320
and none of this is an endorsement

445
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,160
that society has strengths and

446
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,959
weaknesses it has things we can

447
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,040
criticize but we can't make it up

448
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,760
because it's inconvenient to face

449
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,959
the successes they've had and continue

450
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,760
to have

451
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,120
okay so i'm not saying that the ussr did

452
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,680
not grow a lot

453
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,760
obviously the ussr grew massively your

454
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,360
claim is not that the ussr grew

455
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,199
that's not what we're arguing about it's

456
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,920
whether or not the ussr grew at the rate

457
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,399
that it did

458
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,320
due to socialism a country that was

459
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,000
heavily involved in multiple famines

460
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,560
a country that heavily went from little

461
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,720
industrialization to a lot of

462
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,160
industrialization

463
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,000
and a country that engaged in a lot of

464
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,759
imperialistic practices

465
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,519
is a country that grew massively in the

466
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,680
20th century to say that

467
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,040
all of their growth or even the majority

468
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,560
of their growth was due to the

469
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,920
organization of their economy

470
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,920
and not due to factors that were

471
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,360
independent of that organization to say

472
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,880
otherwise that they wouldn't have grown

473
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,240
maybe at an even faster rate now they've

474
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,920
been a capitalist economy

475
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,120
um there would have to be some evidence

476
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,720
provided for that i don't believe that

477
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,839
that's ever been adequately demonstrated

478
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,399
on the contrary i believe some people

479
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,399
have argued

480
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,600
that that russia could have potentially

481
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,120
grown the ussr could have potentially

482
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,480
grown even faster had it abandoned some

483
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,720
of its more outdated

484
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,519
forms of trying to manage their economy

485
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,600
when we bring up

486
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,360
china china has grown a lot under

487
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,800
certain socialist policies for sure

488
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,880
when we look at china especially in the

489
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,440
80s and 90s china began opening itself

490
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,519
up to

491
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,720
massive growth when it comes to foreign

492
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,160
investment china's the number two

493
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,440
country in the world that allows for

494
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,360
foreign direct investment

495
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,800
and the coalescing of all of china's

496
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,279
state-owned the soes estate-owned

497
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,440
enterprises into a select few industries

498
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,800
and then the massive opening of foreign

499
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,399
investment into that country to give

500
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,199
other people more control over privately

501
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,279
owned businesses

502
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,639
has been what has caused the massive

503
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,079
explosion that we've seen of china in

504
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,720
terms of pulling people out of global

505
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,480
poverty

506
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,079
as you mentioned in the video that you

507
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,759
did for the grivel institute you

508
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,199
attribute that to socialist policies but

509
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,639
the thing that really pulled china into

510
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,959
the 21st century in terms of

511
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,040
economic success was the opening itself

512
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,720
up to foreign direct investment was the

513
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,320
opening itself up to other economies

514
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,000
being able to interact with them more

515
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,280
which are all neoliberal trade policies

516
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,799
these aren't these aren't people-owned

517
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,559
businesses these aren't businesses that

518
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,720
are ran by the workers these are

519
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,839
i mean if anything china is a government

520
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,880
that runs the business itself it's a

521
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,319
state capitalist

522
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,640
economy more so than any type of

523
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,240
socialist or communist economy to say

524
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,600
that a single party regime is

525
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,520
having the workers themselves making

526
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,720
decisions over how the any any

527
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,160
individual business is

528
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,240
is uh running i don't think it's fair to

529
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,520
say um i guess one

530
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:33,840
we're really real quick just finishing

531
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:35,440
we're just gonna understanding of china

532
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,799
just this last part the thing that

533
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,160
confuses me the most and the thing that

534
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,480
frustrates me the most i guess when i

535
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,960
have

536
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,160
discussions with socialists is socialism

537
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,960
feels like this like

538
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,720
this very amorphous ever transforming

539
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,240
idea of what it actually is

540
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,000
such that i don't even know why we use

541
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,679
the word anymore so i'm very glad that

542
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,799
you've acknowledged that mark's

543
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,640
in in through his labor theory value

544
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,240
analysis was absolutely flawed and was

545
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,039
an absolute failure i'm glad you've

546
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,039
acknowledged that

547
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,640
the way of analyzing not acknowledged

548
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,080
you're making this stuff up i've never

549
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,720
acknowledged anything of the work okay

550
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,000
well

551
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,600
as you don't even know the way you get

552
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,960
this well earlier you just said that we

553
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,559
shouldn't hold ourselves captive to the

554
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,919
thinking of thinkers in the 19th century

555
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,280
in terms of what socialism is so i

556
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,520
assume you've evolved

557
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,640
no no i didn't do that at all i told you

558
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,039
that socialism

559
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,400
has a variety of theories within it it's

560
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,360
a broad tradition

561
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,840
it had to be in 150 years since marx

562
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,880
wrote

563
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,640
his ideas have moved into every country

564
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,360
on this earth at different levels of

565
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,919
economic

566
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,559
and cultural and political life and of

567
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,480
course

568
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,600
those different people all found

569
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,039
something valuable

570
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,760
but they all made their own

571
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:42,000
interpretations this is a rich diverse

572
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,039
tradition it's as if you you're going to

573
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,360
decide

574
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,440
what it is i mean when i say these

575
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,600
things i never said that the

576
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,200
marxist theory isn't valuable that the

577
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,120
labor theory of value

578
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,320
doesn't apply if you read any of the

579
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,720
books and articles

580
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,679
i've punked out in my life you'd know

581
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,039
that the exact

582
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,240
opposite is the case

583
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,760
wait a minute i want to correct

584
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,640
something about china because you keep

585
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,960
repeating it

586
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,200
okay you know why private enterprise and

587
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:13,520
private capital flows into china

588
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:16,160
in the 80s and 90s because china had

589
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,240
transformed itself from a place where

590
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:22,559
nobody wanted to invest

591
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,559
to a place like now where everybody does

592
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,120
capitalist enterprises went there

593
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:30,799
because they had a well-educated

594
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,840
disciplined labor force at very low

595
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,760
wages

596
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,240
because they had built an extraordinary

597
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,960
infrastructure

598
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,840
because you had a growing level of

599
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,320
income

600
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,360
for people to buy things that's why

601
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,520
general motors

602
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,240
produces and sells more cars in china

603
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:51,039
than it does in the united states

604
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,480
the reason private capital went there

605
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:56,000
was because

606
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:59,520
they had before the arrival created

607
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,200
the institutions every other part of the

608
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,000
so-called third world

609
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,559
asia africa latin america who had

610
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,360
received since the second world war

611
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,840
massive amounts of foreign aid were

612
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,640
desperately trying to do

613
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,640
what the chinese were doing namely

614
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,760
develop their countries so that

615
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,000
foreign private investment would come

616
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,280
china didn't get any foreign aid because

617
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,039
they were communists

618
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,919
and the united states didn't give them

619
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,840
any but they did a better job than all

620
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,640
the countries who did get it

621
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,600
in order to get to the point of economic

622
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,080
development

623
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,799
where it became interesting for

624
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,440
capitalists in japan and europe to go

625
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,280
there you need to pretend for reasons i

626
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,679
do not understand

627
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,640
that all of the achievements i've just

628
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,039
described

629
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,039
didn't happen that somehow they don't

630
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,520
deserve the credit

631
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,200
look in the world of economics maybe

632
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,000
perhaps you're not familiar

633
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,200
we do exactly what you just said we

634
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,320
ought to do

635
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,039
we look at societies and say they have a

636
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,679
capitalist economic system how did they

637
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,679
do

638
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,600
and they have a socialist system with

639
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,720
the different meanings of that term

640
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,840
and how did they do and then we say

641
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,799
they're different and part not all part

642
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,760
of the story

643
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,640
is the different system and if i say to

644
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,200
you that the

645
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,200
socialist transition tradition has

646
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,520
multiple interpretations

647
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,480
let me assure you that the capitalist

648
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,679
tradition

649
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,640
does as well the leaders of saudi arabia

650
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,760
right now

651
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,679
call themselves capitalists

652
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,280
can i can i ask you when you say

653
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,720
socialist what do you what do you mean

654
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,320
when you say socialist then i'm trying

655
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,520
to understand what this means

656
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,600
can you give me like a cohesive

657
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,240
coherence right that's good no let me

658
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,320
answer

659
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,400
they're a variety i'll give you three

660
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,000
basic strains right now they don't

661
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,320
exhaust it but then we

662
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,280
enable us to have a conversation one

663
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,200
strain

664
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,720
you leave enterprises in the hands of

665
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,720
private capitalists

666
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,080
but you recognize that the capitalist

667
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,880
system is so

668
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,919
flawed for example in terms of

669
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,559
inequality

670
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,559
in terms of business cycle instability

671
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,880
that you give a role to the government

672
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,880
of

673
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:17,120
massive intervention rules regulations

674
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,080
laws you know let me give you some

675
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,080
examples

676
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,120
in france it's the law that once you

677
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,960
begin working

678
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,679
after graduating from high school or

679
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,320
college every employer has to give you

680
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,120
five weeks of paid vacation from the

681
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,120
beginning

682
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,000
nothing like that exists in the united

683
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,159
states but this is a society that won

684
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,919
that for its people by the way by

685
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,080
socialists who did that

686
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,520
and put that on the books as it is on

687
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,799
most european

688
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,880
countries and socialists do that

689
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,880
because they believe for them that

690
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,960
socialism is when the government comes

691
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,520
in and regulates that's one kind

692
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,880
here's a second kind these second kind

693
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,400
of socialists they don't believe it

694
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,400
works real well if you do that

695
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,440
it's not enough so they want to take a

696
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,679
different step

697
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,679
they want the government to come in and

698
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,000
actually own and operate

699
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,880
enterprises not merely regulate them

700
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,520
with rules

701
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,280
and laws then there's a third kind which

702
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,120
i stressed a few moments ago

703
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,720
which is not about the government

704
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,159
doesn't care all that much

705
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,240
whether the government runs an

706
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,480
enterprise or the private does

707
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,000
they can figure out map whichever one

708
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,440
works better let's be real

709
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,159
practical but for them what socialism

710
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,720
means

711
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,360
is the transformation of the everyday

712
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,000
life

713
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,840
of working people no longer do you go to

714
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,559
work with other people telling you what

715
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,720
to do

716
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,320
where to sit what machine to use what

717
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,919
raw material to work on

718
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,600
and at the end of the day you go home

719
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,200
and you've got nothing more to say

720
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,960
about what you poured your brains and

721
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,919
muscles into no no no

722
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,760
for these socialists like me the crucial

723
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,960
thing is to reorganize

724
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,360
the workplace to bring real democracy

725
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,080
can you believe it to the place where we

726
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,679
work

727
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,240
in a country that claims to be

728
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,120
democratic we don't have democracy in

729
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,799
the workplace

730
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,480
we have a tiny group of people telling

731
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,440
the majority what to do

732
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,840
fully unaccountable to that majority you

733
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,960
know if we really believed in democracy

734
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,200
this kind of socialism argues we would

735
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,799
recognize that that's where adults spend

736
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,120
most of their adult life

737
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,000
at work and if you really believe in

738
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,080
democracy

739
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,360
it should have been installed in the

740
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,559
workplace but

741
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,640
capitalism doesn't permit that the folks

742
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,760
at the top want to keep the power

743
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,559
to keep their inordinate wealth even at

744
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,840
the

745
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,679
expense of no democracy and of a growth

746
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,520
record

747
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:40,159
inferior to what russia did in the 20th

748
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,559
century

749
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,600
and what china is doing now and that's

750
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,120
an enormous

751
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,840
price to pay okay so if you want to talk

752
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,600
about the

753
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,279
two and three definitions of socialism

754
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,000
that would be interesting to me but i

755
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,600
only heard two

756
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,360
definitions of socials here number one

757
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,080
is just capitalism um i

758
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,480
i don't know when this like redefining

759
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,400
happened of taking capitalism plus

760
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,000
government intervention and calling it

761
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,960
wait let me let me finish

762
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,039
right i don't know why this was the case

763
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,520
that uh state intervention

764
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,440
into private markets to have some form

765
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,080
of regulation or some form of socialized

766
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,400
healthcare

767
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,240
or giving workers five weeks off became

768
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,320
socialism it's clearly not socialism

769
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,679
it's so not socialism that i think marx

770
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,880
himself even said that the state would

771
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,200
be heavily required

772
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,559
in maintaining capitalism uh more so

773
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,840
than i guess even marx was able to

774
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,200
foresee because he predicted a

775
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,000
revolution of the proletariat in his

776
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,080
lifetime

777
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,520
um the idea that the state intervening

778
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,039
and providing some sort of social

779
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,360
welfare or safety net

780
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,360
is is that's just strictly a capitalist

781
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,640
system with some government intervention

782
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,240
if we want to talk about the concept of

783
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,440
the government owning and operating

784
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,640
enterprises or

785
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,799
number three the idea is that the

786
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,240
workers themselves have some like worker

787
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,840
managed thing

788
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,600
i would be interested in discussing

789
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,360
either of those two options as i believe

790
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,159
all five questions i laid out initially

791
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,520
applied to them

792
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,279
but for number one i just i wholly

793
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,960
reject that as a form of capital as a

794
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,320
form of socialism if you believe it is

795
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,360
i'd be curious if you can tell me what

796
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,200
is the difference between

797
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,799
the the first thing you laid out and any

798
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,080
capitalist that acknowledges that some

799
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,880
level of government intervention is

800
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,039
necessary

801
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,559
and keeping the economy going i'd be

802
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,480
glad to explain it to you

803
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,480
the history of socialism gets going in

804
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,120
the middle of the 19th century

805
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,760
and at that time socialists began to

806
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,559
argue

807
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,120
that capitalism was over capitalism was

808
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,919
done

809
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,279
and and a better system was available

810
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,200
and should be pursued

811
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,400
and they had a whole bunch of ideas

812
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,480
about that

813
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,559
they were a relatively small group if

814
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,279
you know the history of marx and marxism

815
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,159
it begins

816
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,039
relatively small as the 19th century

817
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,159
progresses

818
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:42,480
it gets larger and larger and guess what

819
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,279
happens when that movement gets larger

820
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,720
debates begin to happen inside of it as

821
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:50,159
to what in the world

822
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:53,279
capitalism is and what in the world

823
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,520
socialism is and here we go

824
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,559
some of the people decided that

825
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,000
socialism

826
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:02,480
as a radically alternative system wasn't

827
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,120
in the cards could never happen in some

828
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,440
views

829
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,760
could only happen in a distant future

830
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,799
well what then did socialists

831
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,600
do in the meanwhile before a real change

832
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,720
of system

833
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,120
happened answer advocate for the

834
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,840
government to be taken over by universal

835
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,159
suffrage

836
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,200
the mass of people what institute of

837
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,159
socialism

838
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,960
that was if you like a step in that

839
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,760
direction

840
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,440
an early socialism if you like and by

841
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,000
the way there were big debates pro and

842
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,720
khan

843
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
within the socialist movement about this

844
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,279
but they settled to

845
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,240
understand let's call it one kind of

846
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,159
socialism

847
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,840
and that's what you have in western

848
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,440
europe in scandinavia

849
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,080
to this day socialist parties advocate

850
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,120
that

851
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:52,159
and the people in that society

852
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,679
often vote those folks into power i'll

853
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,840
give you an example

854
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,159
the government in portugal right now a

855
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,080
perfect example european country

856
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,080
the government of portugal is a

857
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,559
coalition of three political

858
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,679
parties the largest is the portuguese

859
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,200
socialist party

860
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,200
the second one is the portuguese

861
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,880
communist party and the third one is the

862
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,640
portuguese green party

863
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,320
they were elected as a coalition

864
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,480
government in 2016.

865
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,600
they were re-elected last year

866
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,600
parenthetically

867
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,760
if your audience members don't know

868
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,559
about this that's because you live in a

869
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,279
society

870
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,799
that doesn't tell you about this even

871
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,600
though it's public knowledge

872
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,159
to anyone interested in finding out

873
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,200
those

874
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:36,320
parties push a socialist agenda

875
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,600
by which they mean government rules and

876
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,159
regulations

877
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,039
you may not like to call it socialists

878
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,080
but the people

879
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,960
involved and millions of them around the

880
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,320
world

881
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,720
do the other kind of socialism broke

882
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,480
away from this first kind

883
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,760
in the aftermath of the soviet

884
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,840
revolution

885
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,799
they were in favor of taking that extra

886
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,440
step

887
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,960
socialism for them meant that the

888
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,360
government should take over and

889
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,880
operate enterprises at least the

890
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,559
industrial ones

891
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:11,120
maybe later the agricultural ones and to

892
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,760
underscore their distinction from the

893
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,840
other

894
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,399
socialists who just wanted government

895
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:20,000
rules regulations and controls

896
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:22,480
they gave themselves the name communist

897
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,159
that's the only difference between them

898
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,960
and it has been that way

899
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,399
for nearly a century now since the

900
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,559
russian revolution

901
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,320
and then there's this third one which

902
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,120
has to do with transforming the

903
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,960
workplace

904
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,679
those are all socialisms they argue they

905
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,640
debate

906
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,640
they have a rich literature we have lots

907
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,919
of empirical examples

908
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,919
of all three kinds in the world

909
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,559
and if people want to think about how

910
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,279
they work and what kind of society they

911
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,159
produce

912
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,840
there's loads of evidence there we don't

913
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:59,360
have to hypothesize

914
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,919
or pretend or demonize either because

915
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,159
really

916
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,200
it doesn't lend itself to that if you're

917
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,399
serious

918
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,000
okay first of all just because a

919
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,279
government calls itself socialist i

920
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,360
don't think that that's adequate to

921
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,039
define said government as socialist

922
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,559
right do you agree with it give another

923
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,679
fine you can have enough that's what the

924
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:17,360
debate is this is to

925
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:19,039
make up yourself one second yeah okay so

926
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,320
you we have to give destiny a chance to

927
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,679
speak as well wait well so my question

928
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,080
would be like in terms of opportunities

929
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,000
to

930
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,279
give uh yeah i guess i might would you

931
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,240
consider like for instance like the nazi

932
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,760
party would you consider that a

933
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,880
socialist party as they have socialism

934
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:34,320
in the name it doesn't seem like a good

935
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,799
no why not the minute you know anything

936
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,360
about the

937
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,799
the nazi party you don't understand that

938
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,640
would you say that portugal lives is

939
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,919
portugal a socialist economy

940
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,919
or do they have markets do they have

941
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,279
private investment

942
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,960
markets have nothing to do with

943
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,960
socialism okay can you tell me what is

944
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,120
your definition of capitalism then

945
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,960
i i just because when i ask you what

946
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,559
what is socialism to you i'm

947
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,440
like i understand that you can talk a

948
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,880
lot and you can tell me what other

949
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,720
people have considered socialism to be

950
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,360
but under your current definitions

951
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,480
for instance no no you haven't given me

952
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,279
your definition you've told me what

953
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,559
other thinkers and

954
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,159
other countries in the past your

955
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,120
definition is not what portugal does or

956
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,320
it's not with the portugal

957
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,360
portuguese socialist or communist

958
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,480
parties you're giving me what other

959
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,399
people or other thinkers have thought

960
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,320
what socialism is because

961
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,000
under your current definition number one

962
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,519
the democratic party in the united

963
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
states would be considered a socialist

964
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,279
party

965
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,559
because they're in favor of heavy

966
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,000
government intervention in terms of

967
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,120
climate change or health care

968
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,480
and i don't know if you would agree

969
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,000
would you agree that the democratic

970
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,000
party in the united states of america is

971
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,399
a socialist party or if they rebranded

972
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,880
themselves

973
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,480
okay so so it's clear then that the

974
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,919
naming mechanism alone isn't enough for

975
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,880
you because the nazi party obviously

976
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,000
called themselves socialists i don't

977
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,200
think many people me included would

978
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,880
consider themselves socialist

979
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,279
and it's obvious that there must be some

980
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,320
um there must be some outside definition

981
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,159
that you're alluding to

982
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,679
that when you call something socialist

983
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,360
so i'm just trying to figure out

984
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,559
what what is what can you tell me what

985
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,480
is capitalism here what does it mean

986
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,919
when an economy or or a society is a

987
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,880
capitalist economy what does that mean

988
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,720
to you

989
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,039
well let me answer i gave you three

990
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,559
definitions of socialism i told you they

991
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,559
weren't the only three

992
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,159
this is a debate that's been going on

993
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,919
inside socialism

994
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,000
and it's perfectly reasonable for me to

995
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,320
give you those three

996
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,080
it might be nice for you if there was

997
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,039
one you could cling to but that's not

998
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,440
the way it is

999
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,159
the tradition is too big too broad too

1000
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,120
global

1001
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,919
for there to be one definition as there

1002
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,600
is in most

1003
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,200
interesting things in the world and

1004
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,240
certainly and then many

1005
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:27,200
large organizations and large traditions

1006
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,720
i did give you my own my own is focused

1007
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,120
on the transformation

1008
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,080
of the workplace it's more interested in

1009
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,960
the micro

1010
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,720
transformation than in the the macro

1011
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,640
ones and particularly

1012
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,440
skeptical about the power of the

1013
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,240
government as having had some bad

1014
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,399
consequences i want to learn from these

1015
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,720
early efforts to build socialism

1016
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,679
so that the future revolts against

1017
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,919
capitalism

1018
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,200
will have a better outcome than the ones

1019
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,760
that we've already had

1020
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,919
what does that happen let me finish they

1021
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,640
achieved many things we want to hold on

1022
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,320
to

1023
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,960
and they made some mistakes we want to

1024
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,880
avoid and that's exactly what it means

1025
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,000
to learn from the past now let me

1026
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,960
address the question

1027
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,399
of capitalism here's what capitalism is

1028
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,840
not distinguished by

1029
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,159
and therefore is not useful as a

1030
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,080
definition markets

1031
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,519
slavery has markets it's a different

1032
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,760
economic system

1033
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,840
feudalism had markets for much of its

1034
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,799
history that's not a definition

1035
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,720
of capitalism that's unique capitalism

1036
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:29,279
doesn't uniquely have markets

1037
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,039
at silly free or controlled markets

1038
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,399
which is all we've ever had in the world

1039
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,600
the controlled kind

1040
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,559
are as old as as plato and aristotle who

1041
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,480
argued

1042
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,679
over markets by the way both of them

1043
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,960
opposed markets

1044
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,880
and thought they were socially

1045
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,039
destructive institutions

1046
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,080
just for the as a footnote you might be

1047
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,440
interested in

1048
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:52,159
but capitalism is unique in one way

1049
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,200
it's not a system that's unique in its

1050
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,000
markets

1051
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,399
it's not a system that's unique in its

1052
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,679
quote-unquote free enterprises

1053
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:03,440
those are as old as methuselah but here

1054
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:07,279
is what's unique

1055
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:09,200
earlier systems for example slavery

1056
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:12,159
organized the production of goods and

1057
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,440
services around a dichotomy

1058
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:18,000
a slave and a master the master

1059
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,960
owned all the equipment all the means of

1060
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,520
production

1061
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,320
and including the worker himself and

1062
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,200
herself

1063
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,760
he owned them and that was a very

1064
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,639
unusual way of organizing things

1065
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,679
but it existed for a long time did it

1066
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,480
have markets

1067
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,119
often did it sometimes exist without

1068
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,240
markets

1069
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,280
you bet then there's feudalism radically

1070
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,159
different

1071
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,520
no master no slave nobody's anybody

1072
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,119
else's property

1073
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,520
but you know how that works you have a

1074
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,320
small group of lords at the top

1075
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,919
and a mass of serfs at the bottom and

1076
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,280
the way the system works

1077
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,919
is that the serfs swear loyalty to the

1078
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,320
lord

1079
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,160
and the lord in return to the surf and

1080
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,599
the whole thing is sanctified

1081
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,760
in europe by the catholic church

1082
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,839
okay can't wait for captain let me

1083
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,560
finish then comes capitalism

1084
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,560
it's not a master and a slave it's not a

1085
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,960
lord and a serf

1086
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,040
it's a completely different arrangement

1087
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,480
it's a contract

1088
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,560
it's an employer and an employee

1089
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,680
they don't swear anything to one another

1090
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,079
and neither owns

1091
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,280
the other one but they enter into a

1092
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,920
contract

1093
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,839
in which the employer says i'm going to

1094
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,520
give you a wage at the end of the week

1095
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,520
you're going to give me your brains and

1096
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,320
muscles for these hours

1097
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,599
of these days and that's a deal we're

1098
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,320
going to make

1099
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,160
and that's how we organize production

1100
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,560
that's the distinction

1101
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,079
of capitalism no that's a lot of keys

1102
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,440
it's that's like

1103
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,640
you haven't given me a definition of

1104
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,240
capitalism at all you've told me a bunch

1105
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,040
of things that capitalism isn't and then

1106
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,480
you've given me

1107
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,720
a bunch of random collected facts of

1108
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,720
history but none of these things

1109
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,920
absolutely for instance when you talk

1110
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,280
about how markets aren't unique to

1111
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,960
capitalism that's great worker

1112
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,480
management isn't unique to socialism

1113
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,000
worker management can exist under a

1114
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,960
capitalist system right now i know that

1115
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,240
you like to talk about

1116
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,240
mondragon a lot mondragon

1117
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,760
we're gonna go one at a time here okay

1118
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,960
so let this definition then we'll

1119
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,800
continue when we talk about worker

1120
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,800
managed firms or worker managed co-ops

1121
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,560
these things exist under capitalism

1122
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,640
what what do you okay well what are you

1123
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,040
saying then can i hold on real quick i'm

1124
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,240
sorry

1125
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,680
can i get an explicit answer um that is

1126
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,119
answered within the last 50 years

1127
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,440
without going back into

1128
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,640
feudalism or what the pope said or the

1129
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,040
schism of the catholic church

1130
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,880
i i just i want to know very concretely

1131
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,160
without moralizing or loading anything

1132
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,400
or without talking about something that

1133
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,839
happened in 1850 what is capitalism to

1134
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,400
you what just can you just tell me or

1135
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,480
explain

1136
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,000
what capitalism is because it sounds

1137
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,560
like yeah yeah go ahead

1138
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,520
any definition of anything is they

1139
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,480
process

1140
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,359
of separating it from that which it is

1141
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,599
not

1142
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,400
that's all any definition ever was but

1143
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,240
we don't typically give

1144
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,960
definitions by naming every single thing

1145
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,520
that something is not okay

1146
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,440
is you differentiate it from a cat

1147
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,040
otherwise there's no way to do it

1148
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,880
to differentiate and they give a

1149
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,440
definition of capitalism

1150
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,079
you have to distinguish it from that

1151
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,280
which it

1152
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:18,720
is not those other systems didn't use an

1153
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:22,320
employer employee relationship

1154
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:25,280
that is the core distinguishing quality

1155
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,880
of capitalism slavery doesn't have that

1156
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,280
feudalism doesn't have that

1157
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,880
and i never used the phrase worker

1158
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,960
management

1159
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,160
managers are not what we're talking

1160
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,280
about

1161
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,000
owning and operating if you want a user

1162
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,359
word

1163
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,079
it's workers as their own boss workers

1164
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,200
as their

1165
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:47,520
own board of directors if you like you

1166
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,000
can use the colloquialism in the united

1167
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,480
states

1168
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,240
that has existed throughout our history

1169
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,599
a worker co-op

1170
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:58,560
a cooperative one worker one vote

1171
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,320
all decisions majority vote that doesn't

1172
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,000
exist in capitalism

1173
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:06,960
that exists in a different relationship

1174
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,880
among the people at the workplace not

1175
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,160
slavery not feudalism

1176
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,960
and not employer employee because those

1177
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,079
are different

1178
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,160
people in each of those systems worker

1179
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,119
co-op that's no longer the case

1180
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,160
that's why it's a radically different

1181
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,640
socialist

1182
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,240
system unlike any of the others how can

1183
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,400
you say that that's unlike any of the

1184
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,440
others when co-ops can exist today

1185
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,040
under capitalist economies slavery can

1186
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,240
exist and did it i'm not answering my

1187
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,599
question i'm not i don't wanna i wanna

1188
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,040
show you the negative or of everything

1189
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,920
i'm saying i'm just you're saying today

1190
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,920
that this is a unique thing that exists

1191
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,839
there's never been a problem in any

1192
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,400
society of which we have historical

1193
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,400
record

1194
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,400
for different class structures different

1195
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,400
systems to coexist

1196
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,599
you're asking me a question as if it

1197
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,599
were we

1198
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,640
is this possible it's never been

1199
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,720
anything other

1200
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,839
than the norm but you're telling me that

1201
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,599
in your society

1202
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,359
or i could be wrong you can correct me

1203
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,760
but it sounds like in your excited in

1204
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,520
your society you would exclusively like

1205
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,200
firms to be in the hands of workers

1206
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,760
which would necessarily preclude

1207
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,400
not at all so written that i've never

1208
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,560
said it

1209
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,079
you're just attributing things okay i'm

1210
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,720
sorry i'm trying to train very hard i

1211
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,599
don't know what you're saying but the

1212
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,800
problems your answers are very

1213
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,599
long-winded you're not really answering

1214
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,839
my question so

1215
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,200
am i to understand then that you are in

1216
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,680
favor of a society

1217
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,280
where workers have the option to vote on

1218
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,800
and have control over the workplace but

1219
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,880
there's also room for a private

1220
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,160
investment and the government intervenes

1221
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,000
in things like health care

1222
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,240
or education is this like the type of

1223
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,160
society you're aiming for

1224
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,079
my guess would be that the transition

1225
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,640
from capitalism to what i'm talking

1226
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,720
about

1227
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,880
would have long periods of time

1228
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,960
typically where these different class

1229
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,280
structures these different systems

1230
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,760
coexist with one another okay that's

1231
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,000
what we have today

1232
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,839
no you you don't have it in anything

1233
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,960
like the way i want it well how do you

1234
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,960
want it what's different from your

1235
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,200
vision than what we have today

1236
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,000
well what we have today is predominantly

1237
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,000
capitalist with smatterings of the other

1238
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,720
i'm interested in having predominantly

1239
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
socialist with smatterings of the other

1240
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,079
and without that's the difference and

1241
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,280
without disallowing private investment

1242
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,839
or disallowing

1243
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,520
individual owners how do you get there

1244
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,480
private investment is a completely

1245
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,480
different matter

1246
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,839
you can have private investment and

1247
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,720
worker co-op how

1248
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,280
it exists what's the problem why would i

1249
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,040
ever

1250
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,560
why would i ever invest in a company

1251
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,000
without gaining some amount of equity in

1252
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,359
the company they have no obligation to

1253
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,599
return to many profit i would never

1254
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:33,920
invest in a co-op

1255
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,000
why would you invest in you you invest

1256
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,040
in in businesses in the united states

1257
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,560
correct because let me finish hoping for

1258
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,760
example for something called

1259
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,640
a capital gain you hope that if you buy

1260
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,880
the shares

1261
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,800
and if the company does real well you

1262
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,760
will be able to sell the shares at some

1263
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,880
future point

1264
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,760
to another investor at a higher price

1265
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,560
correct if that company's growth is the

1266
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,760
product of

1267
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,280
its worker co-op organization you're

1268
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,160
perfectly happy

1269
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,119
if you can make an investment that grows

1270
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,640
over time

1271
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,599
but in your world those shares don't

1272
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:12,000
exist and first of all there exists were

1273
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,680
uh these kinds of enterprises exist in

1274
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,720
the world so this is not a hybrid

1275
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,200
they're not then they're not worker

1276
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,960
co-ops by definition a worker

1277
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,560
okay tell me my definition might be

1278
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,319
incorrect so you can correct me

1279
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,000
my understanding is that what makes

1280
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,200
something a worker co-op or what makes

1281
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,880
something employee owned

1282
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,800
is that the means of production or

1283
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,760
whatever firm you operate at

1284
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,680
is wholly owned and operated by the

1285
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,960
workers meaning that when profits are

1286
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,079
generated by that company they're

1287
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,599
returned to the workers and when

1288
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,599
decisions are made about that company

1289
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,960
those decisions are made by the workers

1290
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,720
if that is the definition that we're

1291
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,920
going by there is no room for private

1292
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,599
investment there

1293
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,040
right but that's the wrong definition

1294
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,720
and not the one that operates in the

1295
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,920
world give me your definition definition

1296
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,560
of a worker co-op

1297
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,000
is that the workers make the key

1298
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,760
decisions

1299
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,480
they are their own board of directors

1300
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,520
they may make the decision

1301
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:05,440
democratically

1302
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:08,000
to raise capital for their business

1303
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,280
by selling shares of course they could

1304
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,280
do that

1305
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,800
those shares would not allow the people

1306
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,839
who own them

1307
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,440
to do the steps that they can in

1308
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:17,920
capitalism they would not for example be

1309
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,400
able

1310
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,079
to dictate who's the board of directors

1311
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,400
because the workers themselves

1312
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,000
are their own board of directors but

1313
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,040
there's no problem with private

1314
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,839
investment

1315
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,839
there never was and my question is

1316
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,760
we have this definition i just want to

1317
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,119
hone in on this definition okay my

1318
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,599
question is

1319
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,440
why would any individual ever invest in

1320
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,359
a company that does not have a fiduciary

1321
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,040
responsibility to their investors

1322
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,400
so for instance in your world if i were

1323
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,040
to buy 20

1324
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,000
of a co-op their workers tomorrow could

1325
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,440
say you know what

1326
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,560
we're all bored we don't want to do this

1327
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,760
anymore we're going to move on we're

1328
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,280
shutting the business down

1329
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,000
and now i've just completely lost on my

1330
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,359
investment because they have no

1331
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,880
responsibility to me

1332
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,920
because i have non-controlling shares of

1333
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,720
the only shares you're selling are

1334
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,400
non-controlling

1335
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,839
why would any private investment ever

1336
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,760
come in knowing that that co-op

1337
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:08,720
never has an obligation to make a profit

1338
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,560
or return a dividend to the investors

1339
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,240
there's many companies i'm listed on the

1340
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,839
stock exchange right now that pay no

1341
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,000
dividends to their investors

1342
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,880
here in the united states it's a normal

1343
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,079
part of our no

1344
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,920
absolutely not they might not pay

1345
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,680
i'm talking about capital markets 101.

1346
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,040
they might not pay a dividend

1347
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:28,720
but they are then you're badly

1348
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,480
the foundation of the stock market in

1349
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,319
the united states is a returning

1350
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,760
of capital to the people that are the

1351
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,800
ones doing the investment in companies

1352
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,760
now it might be the case as you

1353
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,920
correctly point out

1354
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,680
it might absolutely it might be the case

1355
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,920
really yeah really

1356
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,160
you're unaware you're you're most of the

1357
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,200
most of the most dynamic companies in

1358
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,000
this country

1359
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,400
are selling stock to people to whom they

1360
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,839
have

1361
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:55,119
no responsibility legal or otherwise

1362
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:56,560
to give them a dividend ever okay

1363
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,000
professor do you believe that a dividend

1364
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,680
is the only way that you can return

1365
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,760
capital to shareholders

1366
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,000
that's not the point that absolutely is

1367
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,240
the point you made no you made the point

1368
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,240
what is the company responsible for

1369
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,119
the companies responsible to run the

1370
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,599
company they are not responsible to give

1371
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,560
money back whether it's dividend return

1372
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,200
of capital or

1373
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,240
any other way to the people who give

1374
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,400
them the money

1375
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,440
to buy shares absolutely people who give

1376
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,400
them the money

1377
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,680
are gambling they hope that they can

1378
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,839
sell the shares

1379
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,599
for more and they will sell the shares

1380
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,599
to anybody who can buy them

1381
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,359
the company's not responsible to buy

1382
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,520
those shares the company's not

1383
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:38,880
responsible for what price they can get

1384
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:41,200
if they lose their shirt tough luck it's

1385
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,040
not an obligation or a responsible

1386
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,760
that's the way the law of this country

1387
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,920
works

1388
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,800
for the stock market and there's no

1389
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,079
problem

1390
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,560
in a worker co-op saying to investors

1391
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,960
we're going to grow better than what you

1392
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,520
can get from a capitalist enterprise

1393
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,760
so buying a share of our stock will give

1394
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,480
you a better shot to sell it at a higher

1395
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,800
price

1396
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,960
later and i can give you examples i

1397
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,960
don't

1398
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,160
of a company that did that just so you

1399
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:13,440
can see why an investor would do it

1400
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,280
i mean you really you can make the

1401
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,319
theater of your hand and i'm not making

1402
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,839
the problem is you're just you said

1403
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,119
something that's just so on its face

1404
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:20,640
absurdly incorrect about the

1405
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,319
characterization of u.s capital markets

1406
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,920
you do you not agree that there exists a

1407
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,200
legally binding the sec

1408
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,800
literally regulates fiduciary

1409
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,079
responsibilities to investors i don't

1410
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,599
like this trick you've pulled

1411
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,119
by making it sound like let me finish

1412
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,560
please let me finish let me finish let

1413
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,560
me finish you've made it sound as though

1414
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,599
i believe the only way to return capital

1415
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,119
to shareholders

1416
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,640
is through dividends that's absolutely

1417
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,240
not the case that's one reading of it

1418
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,960
you can return it via stock buybacks you

1419
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,079
can return it

1420
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,319
uh via increase in growth to do any of

1421
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,400
that you absolutely you have a fiduciary

1422
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,440
responsibility to your shareholders of

1423
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,920
course you do

1424
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,040
if you read if you take my advice i

1425
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,560
teach these courses

1426
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,400
if you read what fiduciary

1427
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:59,680
responsibility means

1428
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,560
it's an abstract generalization it can

1429
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,119
be

1430
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,480
easily demonstrated in thousands of

1431
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,760
legal cases

1432
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:11,359
that there is no obligation of any

1433
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:13,680
material sort that they return money

1434
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:15,280
to the people who invest in them it is

1435
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,920
perfectly okay

1436
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,839
to run your business as you think it

1437
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,040
should best be done

1438
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,920
short of a committing fraud or illegal

1439
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,319
activity

1440
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,000
and that would apply in any system the

1441
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:31,200
investor is taking a

1442
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,040
chance buying your shares in the hopes

1443
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,599
of selling them at a higher price

1444
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,200
it happens all the time and it would be

1445
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:40,240
perfectly consistent

1446
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:42,800
with workers who run their own

1447
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,599
enterprises and are their own board of

1448
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,800
directors

1449
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:48,480
that's not a problem never was there's

1450
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,440
nothing inconsistent

1451
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,760
with private investment on the one hand

1452
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,560
and

1453
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,400
worker co-ops on the other now if you

1454
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,160
have a worker co-op system

1455
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,440
they might decide because we have

1456
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,520
democracy now

1457
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,599
that they don't want that that they

1458
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,000
would like to be the owners

1459
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,280
as well as the board of directors of

1460
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,920
their own enterprise

1461
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,640
that's possible that would be one of the

1462
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,440
variations of worker co-op economic

1463
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,920
systems

1464
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,800
just like we have variations of

1465
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,240
capitalist

1466
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:22,160
systems so in a private business in the

1467
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,760
united states if i invest my money in a

1468
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,440
business a publicly traded business if

1469
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,880
they were to cash out all of that money

1470
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,400
just close the business down and run

1471
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,079
you're telling me that in the united

1472
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,800
states that company wouldn't be held

1473
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,559
liable for scamming its investors

1474
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,079
absolutely that company had a good

1475
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:37,760
lawyer and showed that they made an

1476
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,200
honest effort to have a business

1477
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,200
and then it didn't work out and they

1478
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,160
closed it down the investor would have

1479
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,559
absolutely

1480
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,160
no standing exactly you're right but you

1481
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,920
used a word there an honest effort and

1482
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,280
it's doing all the heavy lifting in that

1483
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,440
statement of course

1484
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,880
you absolutely must show a court that

1485
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,240
you are making a good this is part of

1486
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,599
your fiduciary responsibility you are

1487
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,319
making a good faith effort

1488
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,880
to return money that's what the worker

1489
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,119
co-op

1490
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,640
could easily do we're making a good

1491
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,800
faith honest effort

1492
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,240
to make a business and that business

1493
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,720
requires us to do x

1494
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,599
y and z and the private investor got

1495
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,200
nothing to do

1496
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,359
that happens every day that's not what a

1497
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,680
worker co-ops maximizing for though

1498
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:17,520
a worker co-op if by your definition

1499
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,599
which is a democratically voted

1500
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,040
uh organization is going to be trying to

1501
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,319
take into account what their members are

1502
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,839
voting for they might not vote in the

1503
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,880
best interest of a shareholder

1504
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,800
they might vote to do something

1505
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,400
completely different understood by the

1506
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,119
shareholder that then but that's my

1507
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,520
interest

1508
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:33,280
only only the most naive shareholder in

1509
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,200
the united states believes

1510
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,280
that the company's decisions are

1511
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,160
intended to do the best for the

1512
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,440
shareholder

1513
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:43,200
i can show you 50 000 legal cases in

1514
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,920
which that's not the case

1515
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,760
and which it is contested in the courts

1516
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,000
and you could have that in a workout

1517
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,599
that's

1518
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,520
great and i can show you that and i can

1519
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,160
show you the dow jones the nasdaq and

1520
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,000
the s p

1521
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,000
500 we could go to the uk and look at

1522
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,680
the ftse 250 the ftse one and i can show

1523
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,760
you histories of markets where companies

1524
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,520
do reliably over long periods of time

1525
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,200
return profits whether in the form of

1526
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,680
dividends or the increase in your share

1527
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,200
price

1528
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,559
to people that invest in those companies

1529
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,119
i'm sure you can show me a lot of things

1530
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,559
that happen

1531
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,160
that are bad in capital markets where

1532
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,440
companies uh scam people much because i

1533
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,960
can show you bad things that happen like

1534
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,960
famines under the ussr

1535
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,040
but pointing out to a few bad actors

1536
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,880
does not clear up the problem of the

1537
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,960
fact that investing in a co-op

1538
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,880
where the workers have no obligation to

1539
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,760
return anything to an investment about

1540
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,280
bad actors you're inventing these things

1541
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,760
we were talking about

1542
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,520
private investment and worker co-ops you

1543
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,720
had made a statement that these somehow

1544
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,400
couldn't coexist

1545
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,839
i'm explaining to you that there's not

1546
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,680
the slightest problem

1547
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:39,839
you want to change the topic that's very

1548
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,599
nice but that's what the topic was

1549
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,760
we weren't comparing goods and bad

1550
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:46,559
stories we were explaining

1551
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,760
how and why private investment is not an

1552
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,720
either or

1553
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,880
in relationship to work or co-ops the

1554
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,040
one of the fastest growing industries

1555
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,520
in spain is something called the

1556
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,400
mondragon cooperative corporation

1557
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:02,000
it's a family of worker co-ops they're

1558
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,359
not even worker management

1559
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,680
i don't know if this isn't even a good

1560
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:07,520
it is it is it is the seventh largest

1561
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:10,000
corporation in spain

1562
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:12,160
it's a federation of corporations excuse

1563
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,520
me it's a federation of corporations and

1564
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,880
it's not even worker managed

1565
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,800
that's just worker owned and they have

1566
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,160
all the same exploitative problems they

1567
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,920
go to south america for labor

1568
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,040
they rely on contract labor chomsky's

1569
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,240
criticized the mondragon thing for

1570
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,720
existing in a capitalist framework

1571
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,640
forever

1572
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,480
and even if this was your go-to killer

1573
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:28,079
example the mondragon federation of

1574
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,920
co-ops exists under a capitalist

1575
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,079
framework

1576
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,319
could i finish or do you need to tell me

1577
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:35,680
about the mondagon corporation

1578
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:37,599
i didn't mean to interrupt your lecture

1579
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,640
i'm sorry continue sure you did

1580
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,480
come on who you think you're kidding the

1581
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:45,280
mondegun corporation has

1582
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,920
many parts the biggest single part of it

1583
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,040
are

1584
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,720
a collection of worker co-ops if this

1585
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,920
were the united states we'd call it a

1586
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,000
holding company

1587
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,599
which is a collection of subsidiaries

1588
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,920
that do a variety of things

1589
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:59,440
it's very common in the united states

1590
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,680
and it is very common

1591
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,200
in the world of worker co-ops to do that

1592
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,440
as well the different

1593
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,720
divisions help each other the co-ops

1594
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,880
support one another

1595
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:11,760
that's how the mondragon corporation

1596
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:14,800
went from six people in 1956

1597
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,520
to over a hundred thousand now most of

1598
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,160
the people

1599
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,040
in the mondragon corporation function

1600
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,160
within

1601
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:24,720
their members about 200 companies

1602
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,200
each of which has workers one person one

1603
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,920
vote

1604
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:30,319
making democratic decisions this company

1605
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,960
has been extraordinarily successful

1606
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:34,880
it has out-competed its capitalist

1607
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,760
competitors that's how it became so

1608
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,160
large

1609
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,440
that's how it becomes so successful as

1610
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:42,559
it has been

1611
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,920
it has rules it maximizes because you

1612
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,800
raised that before

1613
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,680
a variety of objectives it is not

1614
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,640
focused

1615
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,280
exclusively on profits the notion that

1616
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,599
profit

1617
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,640
is the bottom line is the very

1618
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,760
convenient

1619
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,880
economic nonsense because profits go

1620
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,359
into the hands

1621
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,520
of the capitalists at the top and of

1622
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:05,920
course they want the company to maximize

1623
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,760
profits because that's what they get

1624
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,599
they don't maximize wages

1625
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,800
because that's what they don't get other

1626
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,520
people get that

1627
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,119
if the other people ran the business its

1628
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,200
objectives would not just be

1629
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,839
profit but the well-being of those

1630
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:22,960
workers the community's well-being

1631
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:25,760
a whole lot of other objectives

1632
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,640
to maximize and you'd have to choose

1633
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,280
among them

1634
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,640
you wouldn't have the essential profit

1635
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,359
maximizing

1636
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,960
which we teach in economics without it

1637
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:37,440
explaining to our students

1638
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,359
that by maximizing profit the whole

1639
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,559
company's life is devoted

1640
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:43,920
to maximizing the return of a very small

1641
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:47,599
number of people

1642
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:49,680
within it okay this is what has changed

1643
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,240
in a worker co-op that's why it's so

1644
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,960
different

1645
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,760
from capitalism it's decisions

1646
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,400
investment

1647
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,680
growth distribution of income all the

1648
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,000
big decisions

1649
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,200
would be made with a different set of

1650
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,440
objectives

1651
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,800
because a different set of people with

1652
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,000
different interests

1653
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,200
are making those decisions for a society

1654
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,240
like ours

1655
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:15,200
that blabbers on about democracy you'd

1656
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:18,200
think this was the most attractive

1657
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:20,400
possible way to proceed because it

1658
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:23,440
democratizes the economy

1659
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,559
by democratizing the enterprises at the

1660
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:28,480
core of that

1661
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:31,520
uh economy instead we live in a society

1662
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:34,400
which pretends that you can have

1663
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,760
political democracy even though in

1664
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,200
economics you have an

1665
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:42,000
autocracy a tiny aristocracy running

1666
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:44,079
each enterprise doing what it wants

1667
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,359
maximizing the part of the output

1668
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:49,359
it gets namely the profit and therefore

1669
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:51,440
we get surprised that our political

1670
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:54,240
democracy doesn't work real well

1671
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,200
hello that's because it's trying to sit

1672
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,319
on top of an

1673
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,520
economic system that is the opposite of

1674
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:03,359
democratic

1675
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:07,040
the proposal of socialists is a proposal

1676
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:07,680
to extend democracy from the political

1677
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,800
realm

1678
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:14,160
to the economic realm why that is

1679
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:17,520
frightening to people who otherwise say

1680
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:20,559
they favored democracy i find

1681
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:22,480
amazing i find it equally amazing that

1682
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:24,319
throughout this entire monologue

1683
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,920
you're all you're advocating for are

1684
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:27,280
liberal markets with a little bit more

1685
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,040
government intervention

1686
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,319
if you want to talk about mondrag

1687
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:32,079
absolutely if you want to talk about

1688
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:33,760
mondragon we can talk about mondragon

1689
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:35,760
until we're both blue in the face

1690
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,359
one it's not worker managed okay it is

1691
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,480
just worker owned a lot of the

1692
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,079
management that comes

1693
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,599
within a lot of the mondragon federation

1694
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,799
come from other workers but they do not

1695
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,720
vote on all of their policies or

1696
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:47,200
productions that is absolutely not true

1697
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,799
number two mondragon does run itself for

1698
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,160
profit that's why if you only change the

1699
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:51,440
means of production and not the mode of

1700
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,000
production you are still producing

1701
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,000
commodities

1702
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,440
for a profit now it happens in this case

1703
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,440
that the profit is going to the workers

1704
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,920
but it still absolutely runs for a

1705
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,200
profit

1706
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,799
that's why socialists point to it and

1707
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,400
say look at how successful it is part of

1708
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:03,920
the reason why successful is the amazing

1709
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,280
revenues and profits that it returns to

1710
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,280
workers that are generated and then

1711
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,839
number three mondragon in order to

1712
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,799
continue to grow in order to continue

1713
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,319
growing one of the problems that

1714
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:13,280
mondragon has started to face recently

1715
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,160
and it's one of the reasons why it's

1716
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,839
criticized by

1717
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,599
people like chomsky is because it had to

1718
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,319
continue to acquire more and more

1719
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,000
workers

1720
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:21,200
that do not get controlling shares that

1721
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,119
don't have the ability to vote what's

1722
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,359
going on mondragon also trades

1723
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,640
across markets including going to places

1724
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:27,760
like south america and trading with

1725
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,440
exploited workers

1726
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,799
so i don't think that mondrag and

1727
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,359
finally mondragon exists

1728
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:35,760
under a capitalist mode of economics

1729
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:37,119
like mondragon exists and interacts with

1730
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,240
other people within a capitalist economy

1731
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:40,000
which i think is good

1732
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,200
if mondragon works and succeeds that's

1733
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,359
awesome i think it's cool i like to see

1734
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,839
alternative types of businesses succeed

1735
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:47,520
but i don't understand how you can talk

1736
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:48,880
about the successes of mondragon

1737
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,400
and then say that like well this is an

1738
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,000
example of the failures of capitalism

1739
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,400
when mondragon exists and

1740
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,079
thrives right now under a capitalist

1741
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,440
framework interacting with so many other

1742
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:58,640
capitalist sections of the economy so

1743
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,119
many other capitalist countries in the

1744
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,880
world

1745
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,559
my problem is that by moving more

1746
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,480
towards what you want you would use

1747
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,359
government policy to necessarily

1748
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,799
disallow

1749
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:08,000
the types of private ownership or

1750
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:09,760
private investment that have been so

1751
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,920
important with other types of inventions

1752
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,760
around the world you can you can keep

1753
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,559
saying that i'm making stuff up but at

1754
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,440
the end of the day

1755
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,799
the problem that we're having to explain

1756
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,640
the problem we're having is i

1757
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:21,920
th the definition of socialism and i

1758
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,440
notice that this is like the it seems to

1759
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,520
be a key problem with people that

1760
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,920
call themselves socialists your

1761
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,440
definition of socialism is so amorphous

1762
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,160
and morphing at any particular point in

1763
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,920
time i

1764
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,520
still don't really have you seem to be

1765
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,480
having trouble with it but that doesn't

1766
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,319
make it amorphous

1767
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,480
it absolutely is amorphous even your

1768
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:39,440
definition of capitalism is absolutely

1769
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,119
amorphous

1770
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,880
um where i i hear rules well you're just

1771
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,760
not familiar with it i'm absolutely

1772
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,160
familiar with it

1773
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,599
like i i absolutely am able to if you

1774
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,640
would like to ask me for my definition

1775
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,000
of any of these things i would be glad

1776
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,359
to explain it and you can tell me you

1777
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,720
can correct me professor if you think

1778
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,200
i'm incorrect in my understanding of

1779
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,200
things

1780
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,640
but i believe that when i ask you to

1781
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,319
tell me like what is capitalism what is

1782
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,760
socialism and it feels like i'm i'm

1783
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:01,440
listening to quebec you know read off

1784
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,799
the board in jeopardy i feel like that's

1785
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,640
damaging to the position that you're

1786
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:06,880
trying to explain more so than me asking

1787
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:08,640
the question

1788
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,160
yeah well let me correct you about

1789
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,440
mondragon

1790
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,000
that which is by the way how it's

1791
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:16,960
pronounced mondragon has

1792
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,799
multiple parts some of the parts are the

1793
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,119
adjustments it's made to living in a

1794
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:21,920
capitalist world that's absolutely

1795
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:27,839
correct

1796
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:27,839
that would have to be any worker

1797
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:42,319
richard industries that grew up in

1798
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,920
feudalism

1799
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:45,040
oh sorry do you mind repeating that last

1800
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,880
line you just cut out there for one

1801
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:50,559
second

1802
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:53,760
right any worker co-op

1803
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:56,640
that forms now has to exist within a

1804
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:59,119
framework of a society that's organized

1805
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:01,440
differently that's exactly the way it

1806
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:04,319
was when capitalism emerged

1807
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,280
out of feudalism the early capitalist

1808
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:08,240
enterprises

1809
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,960
towns villages had to exist within a

1810
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,599
feudal

1811
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,160
framework they had to come to terms with

1812
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:14,319
that

1813
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:16,880
some of them were able to do it others

1814
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:19,359
of them disappeared or were overthrown

1815
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,280
by feudalism until they got big enough

1816
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:22,160
and strong enough and learned from the

1817
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,280
mistakes

1818
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,799
of early experiments in capitalism how

1819
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,680
to set up a system

1820
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:30,480
that would be what it now is the global

1821
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,119
system

1822
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,040
i expect the socialists to kind of

1823
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:37,520
replicate that experience

1824
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:39,359
russia was an experiment china's a

1825
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:42,480
better one

1826
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:43,839
cuba vietnam and so on they make efforts

1827
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,839
they're learning what you do

1828
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:47,040
what you don't do what you replicate

1829
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:49,760
what you avoid

1830
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,559
and they will get eventually to the

1831
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,960
scale

1832
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:54,160
and sense of how to do it on a more

1833
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,839
global scale

1834
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:58,079
that's how feudalism happened that's how

1835
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:58,640
slavery happened that's how capitalism

1836
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:00,880
happened

1837
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,760
and it's reasonable to expect that's how

1838
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,319
socialism

1839
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,520
will happen there is no simple

1840
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,680
definition of

1841
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,440
socialism that would be to use your

1842
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:12,319
words correct

1843
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,520
no agency gives you out a license this

1844
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:16,880
is correct

1845
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:19,920
that one isn't a tradition

1846
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:22,319
as lively as global as socialism

1847
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,680
is always going to have different

1848
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:26,640
interpretations

1849
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,599
different definitions that argue with

1850
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,160
one another

1851
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:30,720
that's healthy that's normal there's

1852
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:34,240
nothing

1853
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:35,200
fuzzy or amorphous about it the idea

1854
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:38,480
that you can have

1855
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:41,200
one definition is an authoritative

1856
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,480
authoritative and authoritarian notion

1857
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:46,079
that there isn't debate

1858
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:48,960
and contestation when there always is

1859
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:50,799
my job was to give you three of the

1860
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:54,240
major definitions

1861
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:57,040
of socialism that contest in the world

1862
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:59,040
today that are widely accepted by

1863
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:01,359
everybody of course not

1864
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,960
but those are the ones that are around

1865
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:06,240
and it's reasonable

1866
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:09,440
to talk about the tradition in that way

1867
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:13,040
can you undergo let me finish mondragon

1868
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:16,319
is an experiment a very successful one

1869
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:19,359
you can if you like attribute everything

1870
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:21,599
to capitalism that happens that's good

1871
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:24,720
and attribute everything bad that

1872
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:27,359
happens to the absence of capitalism

1873
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:29,040
this is never interesting and that's

1874
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,440
really not very interesting and i'm not

1875
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,799
going to

1876
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,400
you know i'm not going to get into that

1877
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:34,240
i will tell you it's good because

1878
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:38,240
there's some remarkable things

1879
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:41,760
that mondragon has done along the way

1880
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:45,200
the majority of its workers voted

1881
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:48,559
the following rule the best paid person

1882
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:52,000
in mondragon cannot get more than eight

1883
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:56,400
to nine times what the least best paid

1884
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:58,799
person is this

1885
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,000
i've been there i've been there i've

1886
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:01,520
watched it

1887
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,079
it's just not true so you're telling me

1888
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:06,480
that of all the employees in mondragon

1889
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,119
the highest paid employees that was a

1890
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,160
decision

1891
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:13,280
that was a decision made by a large

1892
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:13,599
number of the worker co-ops that make

1893
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,280
that

1894
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:17,599
so you're telling me that the highest

1895
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,760
paid employee in mondragon

1896
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:21,839
it has a ratio of what they're any of

1897
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,960
the let me finish in many of the

1898
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:25,839
component

1899
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:28,160
co-ops there you go okay that's correct

1900
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:28,880
it's a holding company of many many

1901
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,960
co-ops

1902
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,480
in many many of those co-ops i can't

1903
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:35,839
speak for everyone

1904
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,480
this was a common rule i went and spoke

1905
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:40,079
with them

1906
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:42,960
i interrogated them about it

1907
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:44,640
and that's what i discovered they passed

1908
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,480
a rule after much debate

1909
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:49,040
that a maximum difference of eight to

1910
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,599
one you know that corporate ceos in this

1911
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,640
country

1912
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:54,480
get roughly on average 300 times what

1913
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,920
the lowest paid worker or even the

1914
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,960
average worker in their

1915
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:01,920
uh employee class what is the ratio of

1916
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,960
what is the ratio they were able to do

1917
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:06,160
something about

1918
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:08,079
inequality wow here they are

1919
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,839
successful in growing they're the

1920
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:11,520
seventh biggest corporation

1921
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:15,520
they're the envy of most other

1922
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:18,319
corporations in europe who cannot

1923
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:19,280
show such a history but they were

1924
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:22,559
concerned

1925
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:23,119
not just to maximize profit but to do

1926
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,720
something

1927
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:28,000
like limit the inequality that otherwise

1928
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:31,280
is so corrosive

1929
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,039
to societies like ours and they were

1930
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:36,160
able to do that

1931
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:38,720
that's an interesting quality thomas

1932
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:41,520
piketty released a book in 2014

1933
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,839
in which he demonstrates in 600 pages

1934
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,640
that

1935
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:45,280
every single capitalism we have a record

1936
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:48,880
of

1937
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:52,160
has built into it a tendency to ever

1938
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:55,200
greater inequality that is only

1939
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:55,839
periodically interrupted by revolts from

1940
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,079
below

1941
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:59,200
like what we had in the 1930s in this

1942
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:02,400
country which

1943
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:03,760
never are durable because once the

1944
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,319
revolt passes

1945
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,520
the tendency of capitalism to in

1946
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:10,240
inequality

1947
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:12,400
grows that has always been an

1948
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:15,440
inspiration to socialists

1949
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,400
to advocate for a system that might have

1950
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:19,680
within it

1951
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:23,680
a built-in mechanism to at least

1952
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:27,119
reduce the inequality that that

1953
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:29,920
haunts capitalism and

1954
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:30,640
the reality is that mondragon and not

1955
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,720
only that

1956
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,400
have demonstrated that there is a

1957
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:37,680
quality of worker co-ops

1958
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:40,480
that does and effectively a good job

1959
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:41,359
of addressing the inequality that

1960
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,839
otherwise

1961
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:44,480
haunts capitalism and that would be an

1962
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:47,599
interesting

1963
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:50,240
way to understand why socialists

1964
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:51,280
would be drawn they are not worker

1965
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:54,000
managed

1966
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:55,520
the way a corporation works is there are

1967
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,240
three layers roughly

1968
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:01,359
the employees who do most of the work

1969
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:04,079
the managers who supervise the employees

1970
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:05,520
and then another group of people to whom

1971
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:08,960
we give the name

1972
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:12,119
directors the board of directors

1973
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:14,640
the shareholders elect the board of

1974
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:15,680
directors because they're the ones who

1975
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:19,119
receive

1976
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:21,359
legally the profits and they decide

1977
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:23,839
what is to be produced how it's to be

1978
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:26,079
produced what technology to use

1979
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:27,599
where the production happens and what is

1980
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:30,559
done with the profits

1981
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:31,119
the managers don't do that so to talk

1982
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:32,640
about

1983
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:34,559
gentlemen gentlemen we're coming up to

1984
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:36,640
we're coming up to the hour now um

1985
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:38,160
we have had uh a disproportionate amount

1986
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,079
of talking time i think uh by you

1987
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:41,440
professor wolf while at the same time

1988
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:43,039
uh destiny would you want to give a

1989
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,680
closing statement to this as we're

1990
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:44,799
coming up

1991
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:47,039
i'll give you a couple minutes to

1992
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,680
respond um i mean i just i take issues

1993
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:49,920
the audience

1994
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:51,039
yeah i mean i just i i man there's so

1995
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,319
many things

1996
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:54,160
citing i just think it's incredibly

1997
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:55,920
disingenuous to open with mondragon

1998
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,920
has 80 000 employees and they voted to

1999
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,520
have an eight to one pay between owners

2000
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,720
and and their and their not owners the

2001
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,520
highest paid employee and the lowest

2002
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,119
paid employee

2003
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,480
but that's not true you corrected

2004
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:06,079
yourself after i corrected you which i'm

2005
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,559
grateful for it's within

2006
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:09,839
within the co-ops within that federation

2007
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:10,960
i'm willing to be that if i were to ask

2008
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,559
you you probably couldn't tell me what

2009
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,480
the highest paid employee

2010
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:16,240
within the mondragon federation is what

2011
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,839
is the ratio of their pay to the lowest

2012
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,720
paid employee of the mondragon

2013
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:20,079
federation

2014
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,440
because it has an incredible vertical

2015
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:22,319
structure in terms of how it interacts

2016
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,400
with itself

2017
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:26,000
now i could just as easily construct to

2018
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,319
a world where the ratio of pay

2019
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,039
between the ceo of amazon or walmart is

2020
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,720
much is

2021
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:32,559
is much smaller where the ratio uh

2022
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,480
closes between the lowest paid employee

2023
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:35,039
if i create a walmart or amazon holding

2024
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,240
company

2025
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:38,079
and i simply split off all the

2026
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,520
managerial people or some sectors of

2027
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:40,160
that company into their own individual

2028
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,359
companies

2029
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,359
and break it up like that the way that

2030
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:44,000
mondragon has not to say that mondragon

2031
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:45,440
has failed

2032
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,200
not to say that they have totally

2033
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,319
different sectors they have i'm not

2034
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,280
making this stuff up everybody can go

2035
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,000
and look at how the company is

2036
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,119
structured everybody

2037
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,039
can go and look at the different types

2038
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,480
of things they have grocery stores

2039
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:56,720
they've got a financial sector

2040
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:58,960
right all right yes but they do not

2041
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:00,319
separate out their managers they do not

2042
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,079
separate out one

2043
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:03,520
group of workers with high pay from

2044
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:05,520
others that's a hustle

2045
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,960
that would be i agree it would be a

2046
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,520
hospital

2047
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:11,119
is just that's make-believe you know you

2048
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:13,280
acknowledge that the

2049
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:15,839
argument is so difficult that you have

2050
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:17,760
to make up the information to support it

2051
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:19,359
my argument is so concrete that i don't

2052
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,520
think i've had to bring up feudalism a

2053
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:23,280
single time to make any of my points or

2054
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,559
ask you any questions related to any of

2055
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:27,119
your points

2056
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:28,319
um so something something something i'm

2057
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:30,400
curious about

2058
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:32,160
would why wouldn't you consider just

2059
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,359
going by the incredibly generous

2060
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,760
definition you give me a point one

2061
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:35,039
social

2062
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,559
why wouldn't you consider the democratic

2063
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,359
party in the united states a socialist

2064
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:40,160
party

2065
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:41,839
as a party that wants to see more uh

2066
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,799
more stuff returned to americans wants

2067
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:43,599
to see people with greater control of

2068
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:46,000
the workplace

2069
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:47,200
um had members that were pushing for 20

2070
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,640
ownership in the share of companies

2071
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,760
bernie sanders aoc why wouldn't you

2072
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:51,839
consider the democratic party in the

2073
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:54,000
united states a socialist party

2074
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:56,160
because it opposes almost everything you

2075
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,480
just mentioned it has a small wing

2076
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:00,160
now that is in favor of it who by the

2077
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,839
way call themselves

2078
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:04,559
socialists but the establishment of the

2079
01:07:02,839 --> 01:07:06,720
democratic party

2080
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:07,680
its history over the last hundred years

2081
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,880
since uh franklin

2082
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,480
that's not fair why would we why would

2083
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,000
you talk about the history of it that is

2084
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,319
that's not relevant because that's

2085
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,200
because history is always absolutely not

2086
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:16,880
relevant you've

2087
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,319
you've said yourself that the history no

2088
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,839
you've said yourself that the way that

2089
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:21,359
we look at socialism today is different

2090
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:23,280
than it was 100 years ago

2091
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:25,599
joseph biden is a product of that

2092
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:28,799
history as he himself says

2093
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:29,280
that party has been unable to make a

2094
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:31,680
government

2095
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:33,119
they couldn't even preserve the level of

2096
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:36,079
government intervention

2097
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:38,400
that was achieved in the 1930s the last

2098
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:41,680
70 years have been a rollback

2099
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:43,359
of the new deal an undoing of it

2100
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:45,520
and that was done as much by the

2101
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:47,599
democratic party as the republicans

2102
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:49,680
they the republicans pushed harder the

2103
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:52,079
democrats could not only not

2104
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,200
advance on what was achieved in the

2105
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:55,760
1930s

2106
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:58,319
they couldn't even preserve it that's

2107
01:07:55,760 --> 01:08:00,480
why we have an unemployment problem now

2108
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:01,920
and have had a terrible experience i

2109
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:04,799
think we have an unemployment

2110
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,480
no absolutely not an unemployment

2111
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:08,960
problem

2112
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,520
proposed a jobs program of the federal

2113
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,640
government

2114
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:14,319
the way worked so well in the 1930s you

2115
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:15,440
couldn't even have the courage to come

2116
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:18,480
up with

2117
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:21,040
with what was already done it's

2118
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:23,199
been a retreat democratic party has been

2119
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:25,679
a retreat from what it did before

2120
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:26,239
all that aoc and and bernie are trying

2121
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:28,880
to do

2122
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:29,759
is to bring back the little bit of

2123
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,839
socialism

2124
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:33,279
that the last 75 years of the democratic

2125
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:36,159
party have been devoted

2126
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:37,359
to getting rid of that's why they're so

2127
01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:40,319
embarrassed

2128
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:41,040
these political centrists by the rise of

2129
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:44,880
the left

2130
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:47,120
they thought it was over no

2131
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,640
this is an unimaginable analysis of

2132
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,279
political parties today in the united

2133
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,359
states

2134
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,960
i don't think the closed shop policies

2135
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:55,279
that bain are advocating for

2136
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,719
represent some walk-back and policies or

2137
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:58,000
i don't think that the democratic party

2138
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:00,400
and the republican party push

2139
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,520
equally or even remotely similarly for

2140
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,400
the types of economies that they'd like

2141
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,920
to see today

2142
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,520
um whether or not you have problems with

2143
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,640
how the democratic party functions i

2144
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,319
don't know if your issues are with the

2145
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,920
democratic party or the politicians that

2146
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:11,600
americans elect i know that it's a very

2147
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,120
popular pastime among lefties to

2148
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,799
demonize the democratic party for not

2149
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:17,120
being able to authoritarianly

2150
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:18,400
or totalitarianly rule the country uh

2151
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,920
absent you know the other half of

2152
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,239
congress it seems like a lot of people

2153
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,600
uh

2154
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:23,279
on the left don't seem to understand how

2155
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,799
our government functions i don't know if

2156
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:27,920
that includes you or not

2157
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:31,040
um but yeah i think just given

2158
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:32,560
given we have we have folks like you

2159
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:35,839
that will help us

2160
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:37,839
uh yeah i guess we'll see yes

2161
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:39,279
i mean all i learned the thing that i've

2162
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:40,640
learned the most today i'm happy to see

2163
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:42,319
that the democratic party under

2164
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,040
definition one of socialism i guess is

2165
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,400
considered

2166
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,239
uh at least somewhat of a socialist part

2167
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,920
of you as they are uh believers of

2168
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:48,319
enterprise and private capitalists and i

2169
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,239
guess

2170
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:52,080
yeah i just spoke against that how you

2171
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:54,239
got out of that

2172
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:56,159
well you started to you you started to

2173
01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:57,360
you started to appeal

2174
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:59,199
you started to appeal to things the

2175
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,880
democratic parties advocated for or

2176
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:02,560
appealed to a history 100 years back

2177
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,679
like okay we've turned we've turned into

2178
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,199
a fox news channel let's

2179
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:07,280
let's slow it down we're gonna get right

2180
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:09,280
to the audience q a okay

2181
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,480
all right so we have uh we have hundreds

2182
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,679
and hundreds of questions unfortunately

2183
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,640
we're not gonna get to all of them i'm

2184
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:14,320
gonna try and time

2185
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:16,400
uh both of your responses to about two

2186
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,600
minutes so i'll give you like a 10 to 15

2187
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,320
second warning when you're coming up to

2188
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,800
that

2189
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,600
um so the first one is going to you

2190
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,000
destiny

2191
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:26,159
what could convince you uh that your

2192
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,920
system or your defense of capitalism

2193
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:29,199
is wrong and that socialism is a better

2194
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:31,040
path forward

2195
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:32,080
um i think seeing these things try it on

2196
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,360
a smaller level and then having more

2197
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:35,040
success on larger and progressively

2198
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:37,120
larger levels would be convincing

2199
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,320
um the thing that oftentimes troubles me

2200
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:40,000
when people advocate for different

2201
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:41,760
economic systems is

2202
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,280
uh much like wolfe has done and says

2203
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,719
maybe the he won't say he's done this

2204
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,400
but the moralizing of like the

2205
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:48,000
relationship between an employee and

2206
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,920
employer or the moralizing

2207
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,679
of different aspects of who owns the

2208
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,640
means of production or or who works in

2209
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:54,800
the means of production

2210
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:56,719
i'm not really interested in the

2211
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,560
relationship between a boston worker

2212
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,920
what i'm more interested in are the

2213
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,560
material conditions of people at the end

2214
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,239
of the day

2215
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:04,560
um if different relationships are more

2216
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:06,320
beneficial to growing the economy

2217
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,360
rather than shrinking the economy but

2218
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,080
producing a quote unquote better

2219
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,600
relationship

2220
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:11,679
i'm more in favor of the former than the

2221
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,080
latter i like capitalism because i think

2222
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:14,239
that

2223
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:15,920
having private enterprise uh adequately

2224
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:17,199
allocates capital into sectors of the

2225
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,719
economy they desperately need that

2226
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:20,239
capital allocated to it

2227
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:21,360
um i understand that uh wolfe is

2228
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:22,159
laughing because he's probably gonna say

2229
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,920
something like oh well what about

2230
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:25,120
healthcare and education and i'm so glad

2231
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,560
that me and the rest of my liberal and

2232
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,679
even neoliberal friends agree

2233
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:29,760
that there are times when the government

2234
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:30,880
can step in and it can alleviate some of

2235
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,400
the problems that the free market

2236
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,600
doesn't address for instance capitalism

2237
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,040
doesn't solve well for things like

2238
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,159
health care or education

2239
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,679
something that we desperately need to

2240
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,080
realize in the united states as we work

2241
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:39,679
to

2242
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:41,600
i guess you could say socialize those

2243
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:44,719
industries which i'm so glad can happen

2244
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:46,400
in a capitalist framework

2245
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:47,679
all right uh professor wolf do you want

2246
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,480
to respond to any of that or just get a

2247
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:49,760
direct question

2248
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,199
and if you are going to respond i'm

2249
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,800
going to keep the timing to the

2250
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:55,360
two-minute window no i

2251
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,080
no i think this is rehashing stuff we

2252
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:58,960
went over so

2253
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:59,280
how about another question all right so

2254
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,120
for

2255
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,640
professor wolf were a state to become

2256
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,840
socialists how would it thrive within a

2257
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,520
hostile capitalist world without

2258
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:07,280
resorting to the authoritarianism

2259
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,280
and imperialism of 20th century

2260
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:12,400
socialism

2261
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:13,840
i find this sort of remarkable these

2262
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:16,800
kinds of questions

2263
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:18,239
imperialism the imperialism that we

2264
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,560
study

2265
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:21,520
as people who are interested in this

2266
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:24,640
topic

2267
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:26,800
is a product of capitalism the

2268
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:29,760
subordination of the third world

2269
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:30,800
asia africa and latin america was a

2270
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:34,719
subordination

2271
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:37,199
organized and operated by capitalist

2272
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:39,360
institutions and capitalistically

2273
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:42,640
dominated societies

2274
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:44,800
imperialism serious issue for sure

2275
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,679
but it is serious issue that is the

2276
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,960
product

2277
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:52,159
and the activity of capitalism

2278
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:53,840
if you would like to talk about things

2279
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:57,040
the soviet union did

2280
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,840
and china has done in terms of their

2281
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:00,159
activities

2282
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,840
in and around other countries and you

2283
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:04,880
want to apply

2284
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:07,120
the term imperialism

2285
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,640
fine you'd have to make some adjustments

2286
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:10,880
because the logic was different

2287
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:12,080
and the outcomes were different and the

2288
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:14,880
scale of it was

2289
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:17,760
utterly different we didn't have the

2290
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:20,800
soviets and the chinese at least not yet

2291
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:22,560
have had not organized world wars to

2292
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:25,280
hold on and to expand

2293
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,800
their imperialist empires like world

2294
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:30,719
wars one and two

2295
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:33,920
so it i find the whole question strange

2296
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:34,880
to put forward especially without any uh

2297
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:38,080
explanation

2298
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:41,280
and now to address briefly the question

2299
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:45,040
what a state that became socialist

2300
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:48,320
would do depends on which of the three

2301
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:51,280
basic definitions i offered that state

2302
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:53,159
embraced if it believed that socialism

2303
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:54,480
was what you have in western europe and

2304
01:13:53,159 --> 01:13:57,040
scandinavia

2305
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:58,000
that's what it would do it would have no

2306
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:01,360
problem

2307
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,960
excuse me oh we got 15 seconds left okay

2308
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:05,120
that's what it would do if it followed

2309
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:06,880
the soviet model that's what it would do

2310
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:09,760
and if it did the kind of thing that i'm

2311
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:12,560
advocating and the socialists like me do

2312
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:16,400
then it would be devoted to changing the

2313
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:16,400
organization of enterprises

2314
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:21,920
democracy

2315
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:29,840
into enterprise inside capitalist

2316
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:32,480
enterprises

2317
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:34,239
okay to destiny do you think that jeff

2318
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,760
bezos works hundreds of thousands of

2319
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:37,199
times harder than his workers

2320
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:39,760
why should he be the richest person in

2321
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:41,120
the world um you don't get compensated

2322
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,640
based on how hard you work you get

2323
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:44,000
compensated based on the demand for your

2324
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:46,159
particular set of skills

2325
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,000
um there's probably less people that can

2326
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:49,920
work in the position that bezos does and

2327
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,159
there are people that can work

2328
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:54,800
in any other more entry level position

2329
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:54,800
at amazon

2330
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:59,040
wow okay wait wait do you disagree with

2331
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,560
that do you think just as many people

2332
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:02,000
could handle being the ceo of a

2333
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:03,679
multi-billion dollar company as could

2334
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,120
handle being somebody that

2335
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:06,400
works in a grocery store or a fast food

2336
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:08,840
restaurant is there a simple yes or no

2337
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:10,080
to that or am i about to get another

2338
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,920
lecture

2339
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:13,840
well you don't want an answer you you

2340
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,199
want you just want the answer you want

2341
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:17,280
you don't want it in a

2342
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:20,080
form can i get an answer that doesn't

2343
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:20,080
involve feudalism

2344
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,000
that's not cute is that what the point

2345
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:26,320
is here

2346
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,320
okay

2347
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,800
why don't you just let me respond

2348
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:32,159
without coaching me how to do it

2349
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,000
can we do that okay i'll give i'll give

2350
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:34,560
i'll give you two minutes i'll go back

2351
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,120
we'll go there

2352
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:42,400
fine the the idea

2353
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:44,880
advanced by you earlier

2354
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:47,120
that you don't have one person walk away

2355
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:49,600
with 200 billion dollars roughly the

2356
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:51,600
estimate of businesses worth and the

2357
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,280
vast majority of his employees

2358
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,760
unable to pay for their kids to go to

2359
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:58,960
college is a distribution

2360
01:15:55,760 --> 01:16:02,320
of the profits of that business that

2361
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:05,040
is morally reprehensible

2362
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:06,560
that's how the wealth was accumulated by

2363
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:10,400
the distributions

2364
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:13,440
of share dividends to shares share

2365
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:16,640
expansion and share improvement in value

2366
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:19,199
we have a system that rewards one

2367
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:20,719
person with 200 billion and another one

2368
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:23,600
with thirty thousand dollars

2369
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:24,640
that's a remarkable decision to make in

2370
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:27,920
a community that

2371
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:29,199
calls itself uh democratic or that what

2372
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,560
likes to believe

2373
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:35,920
it wants to give people a fair and equal

2374
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:39,840
chance no fairness here no equality

2375
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:41,920
it is revolting to me that anyone

2376
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,600
could find this reasonable and to

2377
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:46,480
explain it by saying

2378
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:47,440
there's a demand that's simply what the

2379
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:50,320
corporations

2380
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:51,440
give each other the demand they're the

2381
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:55,120
ones who

2382
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:57,440
create the which they then

2383
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:58,719
fill with themselves because they're the

2384
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:00,560
ones who hire

2385
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:01,760
each other for that job it's a

2386
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:04,080
remarkable

2387
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,960
self-serving system where the folks at

2388
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:08,400
the top

2389
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:10,640
give themselves as much as they can

2390
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:12,159
get away with and if it were looked at

2391
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:14,800
that that way

2392
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:17,840
it would not survive 10 minutes wait

2393
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,840
what was the original question

2394
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:25,360
wait hold on we were asking we were

2395
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:28,239
asking how we react to that inequality

2396
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:30,000
no the question was why i asked you why

2397
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:32,080
do you think bezos is compensated so

2398
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,280
much more than a love like a frontline

2399
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,960
employee do you think that

2400
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:36,320
the demand for those talents is equal

2401
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,520
between somebody that could be a ceo

2402
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,800
versus somebody that could work in a

2403
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:41,120
sense i don't think the demand

2404
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:42,480
for that talent is an explanation of

2405
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:44,000
anything you'd have to explain why the

2406
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:46,080
demand is what it is

2407
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,440
who makes the demand sure i can yeah

2408
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,560
what we can talk about all of that i

2409
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,760
would imagine you as a professor should

2410
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,159
know the answer to all these questions

2411
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,760
right

2412
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:53,280
who make who where is the demand to

2413
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,800
running a multi-billion dollar company

2414
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,920
that turns profits for people that i

2415
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,560
mean like you can explain all of these

2416
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,679
things i don't know why you would

2417
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,719
pretend there's not answers you're very

2418
01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:00,880
clear

2419
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:02,239
you can you can cast whatever persians

2420
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:04,800
you want on my

2421
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:08,080
qualification i'm not casting any

2422
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:08,080
inspirations on your qualifications

2423
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:11,920
it's disappointing that instead of

2424
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:13,199
getting an actual answer to anything it

2425
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:15,600
was all moralized that's all

2426
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:16,400
we had but okay let's let's see the q a

2427
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,719
okay sure

2428
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,239
um all right the next the next question

2429
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:23,199
uh i believe goes to

2430
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:23,920
you destiny if you identify as a sock

2431
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,600
dem

2432
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:28,719
why is it that you did not publicly

2433
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:31,120
support bernie sanders during his run

2434
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:32,400
um i think that some of what bernie

2435
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,920
sanders advocates for

2436
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,679
goes in directions that i think would be

2437
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:37,360
detrimental to the economy there were

2438
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:38,960
larger policies that he had i don't know

2439
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,640
how i feel necessarily about a national

2440
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:42,239
jobs guarantee i definitely don't like

2441
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,199
the push for like nationwide rent

2442
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:45,199
control

2443
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:46,320
um these are just uh certain types of i

2444
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:48,480
don't know the economy can handle like a

2445
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:50,239
15 an hour federal minimum wage

2446
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:51,600
at the at the federal level um there

2447
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:52,960
were just a lot of policies that bernie

2448
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,000
sanders pushed for i think at one point

2449
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,760
he pushed also for that plan

2450
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,960
for twenty percent of every business

2451
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,400
would be owned by workers i don't know

2452
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,400
how the united states managed that

2453
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:02,480
and then his version of medicare for all

2454
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:04,080
went like more extreme than any other

2455
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,560
version of socialized healthcare in the

2456
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,000
world

2457
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,120
um a lot of these things just pushed it

2458
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,080
way too far for me i didn't think they

2459
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,520
were politically viable

2460
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,880
i would have taken bernie sanders easily

2461
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:12,640
over donald trump or probably a few of

2462
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:14,000
the other democratic candidates but

2463
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,199
i just felt like they were better better

2464
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,760
middle grounds than what bernie sanders

2465
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:17,760
was pushing for

2466
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,000
okay to you professor wolf um what is

2467
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:24,080
the best way to judge

2468
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:27,760
the success of an economic system uh

2469
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:27,760
such as capitalism or socialism

2470
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:31,760
well you know there are many many

2471
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,520
dimensions many standards many metrics

2472
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:35,760
that you can use

2473
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:38,080
one of them is economic growth the other

2474
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:40,239
one is the distribution of wealth and

2475
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:43,360
income that the society

2476
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:46,960
and the economic system generate

2477
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:48,640
for me i i'm committed to asking the

2478
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:50,800
question whether the people who do the

2479
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:53,440
work who pour their brains and

2480
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:54,800
their muscles into the production of

2481
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:57,360
goods and services

2482
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:58,560
are or are not entitled to participate

2483
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:00,400
in deciding

2484
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:02,480
how those goods and services are

2485
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:04,159
distributed how the income

2486
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:06,560
if they're sold in markets is

2487
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:08,000
distributed i would like to see human

2488
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:10,800
beings have the right

2489
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:13,280
to participate democratically in the

2490
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,520
workplace it is at least as important

2491
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:17,040
as participating democratically in the

2492
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:19,760
residential community

2493
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:20,320
where you live we have the forms in the

2494
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:23,440
latter

2495
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:26,400
and the complete absence of it so for me

2496
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:28,719
a test of an economic system would be

2497
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:31,840
how much

2498
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:34,320
real democratic participation in both

2499
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:36,719
work and residential community life

2500
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,520
people are able to have and on that

2501
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:40,080
ground

2502
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:42,880
capitalism falls so far short that it's

2503
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,880
an easy choice

2504
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:47,600
okay to destiny uh under the current

2505
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:48,480
conditions of covid and everything

2506
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,080
that's happened as

2507
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:52,080
so many people seem to be suffering and

2508
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:54,159
a distratified people between classes

2509
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:56,239
how can you still defend capitalism

2510
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:57,600
i i don't know people seem to i believe

2511
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:59,040
sorry this one is specifically about the

2512
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,480
u.s response i think that

2513
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:02,719
yeah sure people like to attribute like

2514
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:04,000
so many strange ills i i noticed um

2515
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:05,679
professor did it earlier when he said

2516
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,120
our unemployment is very high right now

2517
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:08,320
like that's a fault of capitalism and

2518
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:10,000
we're just ignoring the worldwide

2519
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:12,560
pandemic that's currently occurring

2520
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,520
um i i just there are ways that our

2521
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,199
government right now

2522
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,960
can respond to the pandemic that don't

2523
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:18,320
require it to be a socialist government

2524
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,679
there have been far more left-leaning

2525
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:21,199
governments and other countries that

2526
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:23,760
have failed to respond to the pandemic

2527
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:26,159
you can look across the entirety of

2528
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:27,760
europe for examples of that if you wish

2529
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:29,199
um i just i think that these two things

2530
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,719
are totally disassociated from other i

2531
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:31,920
think that it is possible to maintain a

2532
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,679
capitalist economy

2533
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,040
while also having adequate intervention

2534
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:36,719
from the government to alleviate the

2535
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,280
problems that we have with the pandemic

2536
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:38,719
which

2537
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,000
we're starting to see under biden

2538
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:41,280
unfortunately it's taken a while but

2539
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,960
even under trump we saw things like the

2540
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:44,480
character and whatnot as well

2541
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,239
wait wait let him keep speaking he still

2542
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:47,600
has uh oh no sorry i didn't want to

2543
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:50,080
interrupt him during my answer go ahead

2544
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:50,080
professor

2545
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:54,080
yeah i would respond in in two ways

2546
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:56,000
number one

2547
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:57,440
the united states has four percent of

2548
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,800
the world's population

2549
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:03,120
and 20 of the world's covet deaths

2550
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:04,159
for a rich country with a well-developed

2551
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:07,280
medical system

2552
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:10,800
that is a systemic failure beyond

2553
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:13,280
all words so for me yeah

2554
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:15,040
this is a problem of a system that could

2555
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:17,920
not prepare itself

2556
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:18,400
properly for a pandemic it knows could

2557
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:20,880
happen

2558
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:23,199
given the one that we had a century ago

2559
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:25,679
and there are many since that time

2560
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:26,960
and it is likewise a system that was not

2561
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:29,360
able to cope

2562
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:31,520
very well with what it was unprepared

2563
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:32,159
for the second and final thing i will

2564
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,000
say

2565
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:36,000
is i notice that there are three

2566
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:40,080
governments in the world right now

2567
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:42,960
the united states brazil and india

2568
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:45,520
characterized by right-wing governments

2569
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:48,880
for most of the time of the pandemic

2570
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,120
trump here bolsonaro in brazil and modi

2571
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:51,760
in

2572
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:53,120
india their performances these three

2573
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:56,400
countries

2574
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:57,760
of these three right wing super pro

2575
01:22:56,400 --> 01:23:00,800
capitalist leaders

2576
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:03,840
are among the worst in the world

2577
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:06,239
more than pretty much every place else

2578
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:07,920
and i think that speaks volumes to

2579
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:10,000
what's at stake

2580
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:11,280
in making this decision between the

2581
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,000
pro-capitalist

2582
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:15,040
and the pro-socialists i mean just to be

2583
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,320
clear the uk

2584
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:19,920
italy i mean like there are other

2585
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,120
countries that did worse in the united

2586
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,639
states and then

2587
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:25,440
comparably there are countries that also

2588
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:25,760
did um that's an amazing standard to you

2589
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:25,760
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

2590
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:25,840
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

2591
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,639
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

2592
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:30,400
let's finish it

2593
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:31,840
wait just let this knee finish with this

2594
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:33,360
response we'll do it one minute time and

2595
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,320
then we'll we can get a response back i

2596
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,320
mean like if you want to look at like

2597
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,920
the deaths per 1 million population like

2598
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:39,600
a lot of countries around the world drop

2599
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:41,040
the ball on this some did very well

2600
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:42,639
and some of the ones that did very well

2601
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,239
are capitalist countries you know places

2602
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:45,840
like south korea that have like heavily

2603
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:47,440
liberalized their economy or bastions of

2604
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:48,560
like capital success have done very very

2605
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,440
well when it comes to tracking and

2606
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:51,040
dealing with this

2607
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,239
um you know australia new zealand are

2608
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,280
capitalist countries and they also did

2609
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:54,960
very well countering this

2610
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:56,800
um places like the united kingdom that

2611
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:58,480
has socialized healthcare that provides

2612
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,960
education for its citizens they had a

2613
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,800
worth

2614
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:02,000
worse deaths per million than the united

2615
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,679
states did um

2616
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,280
again i'm not saying that like hooray

2617
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:06,400
capitalism can save us or you know any

2618
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,520
of that stuff i'm just saying that how

2619
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,440
your country did

2620
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:11,920
i don't think is necessarily reliant on

2621
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:13,440
the uh organization that you have

2622
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,960
in your economy i think it's more

2623
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,159
important to see what type of action

2624
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:18,159
does your government take

2625
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:19,679
which i don't know maybe wolf has a

2626
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:21,199
definition of socialism where it's

2627
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:22,800
also the government coming in and

2628
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:24,000
intervening for diseases but you know

2629
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,520
whether you have all worker co-ops or

2630
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,560
all privately uh managed firms i don't

2631
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,760
see how that matters when it comes to

2632
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:30,150
how your country addresses

2633
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,760
uh coronavirus

2634
01:24:30,150 --> 01:24:32,800
[Music]

2635
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,920
do you want a one minute response to

2636
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,440
that and then we'll move on to the next

2637
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:38,080
question yes okay

2638
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:38,639
at the beginning of this discussion

2639
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:42,000
steve

2640
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:44,719
rattled off about how

2641
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,679
socialist societies have never succeeded

2642
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:48,400
so

2643
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:49,199
he generally equated the socialism but

2644
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:51,280
the success

2645
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:52,400
i try to do that now in terms of the

2646
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:54,880
coveted response

2647
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,920
and he takes exception he doesn't want

2648
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:58,000
it to be so

2649
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,040
he doesn't like the linking of the

2650
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,120
social system

2651
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:02,960
with the problem well you really can't

2652
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:05,440
have it both ways

2653
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,639
i didn't point out that socialism come

2654
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:09,120
in capitalist countries

2655
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:10,159
had some general difference i pointed

2656
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:13,040
out that the

2657
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:14,080
three of the worst examples of mass

2658
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:16,719
death

2659
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:17,760
happened in societies led by people on

2660
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:20,719
the extreme

2661
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:21,840
right that that leaves a big open space

2662
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:26,400
for the variety of

2663
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:29,280
other less extreme situations

2664
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:31,360
that's the point of it all it's not that

2665
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:33,600
capitalism is the cause of everything

2666
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:34,639
but that it contributes in ways that you

2667
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:38,400
can identify

2668
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:41,840
and trace i i i i

2669
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,840
can i get a five

2670
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,840
i think that you would have an easier

2671
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:47,280
time blaming chernobyl on socialism than

2672
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:49,199
you would the coronavirus response on

2673
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:50,960
capitalism that's all i'm saying

2674
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:53,360
exactly that's exactly what you're

2675
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:56,480
saying i see that thank you

2676
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:57,760
okay uh can we uh two more questions

2677
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:59,040
gentlemen uh do we have time for that is

2678
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:00,400
that all right i got all the time in the

2679
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:02,800
world

2680
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:04,159
okay uh to professor wolf worker

2681
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,360
cooperators survive and thrive all over

2682
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,480
the world by the thousands

2683
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,920
why couldn't we build a stable

2684
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,920
sustainable economy based on the bottom

2685
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,600
up democratically when cooperatives

2686
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,280
emulate that model here in the u.s why

2687
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,840
hasn't it taken it off yet or sorry why

2688
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:17,440
hasn't it taken off yet

2689
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:20,239
well there are many reasons you know

2690
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:21,280
capitalism and i will apologize in

2691
01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:23,760
advance for

2692
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:25,920
referring to feudalism and other systems

2693
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:28,080
they not only take a long time to get

2694
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:30,320
going and to settle in

2695
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:32,159
but when they do one of the reasons they

2696
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:35,840
succeed is that they develop

2697
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:36,639
a culture a politics that is consistent

2698
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:39,440
with

2699
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:40,960
that is built so it reinforces the

2700
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:44,080
economic system

2701
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:44,880
upon which it sits capitalism is no

2702
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:47,920
different

2703
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:51,199
if you begin to break down as capitalism

2704
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:53,280
is now doing and you see efforts

2705
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:54,400
whether they work at co-ops socialist

2706
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:57,120
movements uh

2707
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:58,560
labor movements and so on beginning the

2708
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:01,120
construction the slow

2709
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:02,960
construction of alternatives they're

2710
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:05,760
going to encounter

2711
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:06,400
politics and culture that stand in the

2712
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,960
way

2713
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:10,480
politics and culture that militate

2714
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,239
against it

2715
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:14,320
i can't tell you the number of times i

2716
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:17,040
explain worker co-ops to people

2717
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:19,199
who really can't get their heads at

2718
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:19,920
first around well gee how do they get

2719
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:21,920
money or

2720
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:23,440
how do they solve their problems or how

2721
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:26,239
do they grow

2722
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:26,960
because in their world there has to be a

2723
01:27:26,239 --> 01:27:28,880
boss

2724
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:31,520
and the boss has to be in other words

2725
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:33,679
they have adjusted their own life

2726
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:34,880
expectations and understanding of how

2727
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:37,679
the world works

2728
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:39,679
to the way it is now all of that is

2729
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:42,239
breaking down but it takes

2730
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:42,880
time and i think that's why the you'll

2731
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:45,440
see

2732
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:46,800
that while worker co-ops have existed

2733
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:48,800
from the beginning when the united

2734
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:53,440
states was even just a colony

2735
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:56,159
why it takes a long time before the

2736
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:58,560
combination of breakdown of capitalism

2737
01:27:56,159 --> 01:28:01,040
and the emergence of these alternatives

2738
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:02,639
gets up to speed so that people's

2739
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:06,480
political and cultural

2740
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:08,880
awarenesses allow them to flourish

2741
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:10,960
all right final question to you destiny

2742
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:12,719
uh why do you never mention vietnam

2743
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:15,040
especially in relationship to

2744
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:16,560
how they handled kovid and their success

2745
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:18,239
in that area

2746
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:19,920
um i don't know specifically why i

2747
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:21,280
looked into um for all of my cover

2748
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:24,320
debates it was usually

2749
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:26,320
new zealand australia south korea

2750
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:28,320
and then on the flip side places like

2751
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:29,760
the united states and the the uk for

2752
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,480
examples of successfully handling the

2753
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:32,400
pandemic

2754
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:33,760
versus unsuccessfully handling it um in

2755
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:35,040
terms of uh that that's for the

2756
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,159
coronavirus stuff in terms of like

2757
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:38,639
economic history

2758
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:39,600
my understanding is that vietnam tried

2759
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:40,960
the you know their

2760
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,480
single party state labor unions kind of

2761
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,840
like this under one party they had a

2762
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:46,239
heavily socialized economy

2763
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:48,400
but much like what existed in the ussr

2764
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:49,679
people after their you know work shifts

2765
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,840
would have to spend time throughout the

2766
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:53,679
day um engaging with like a shadow

2767
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,719
economy or kind of a black economy or a

2768
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:55,679
black market where they would have to

2769
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:56,080
buy and sell the goods that weren't

2770
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:58,400
otherwise

2771
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:59,760
available in their country um in the in

2772
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:01,199
russia they did this with a system or in

2773
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,840
the ussr they did this with a system of

2774
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:02,960
blots

2775
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:04,719
um i don't know if they've got a formal

2776
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:06,480
name for it and the vietnamese economy

2777
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:08,159
but it seems like the way that vietnam

2778
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:09,280
has worked to kind of modernize their

2779
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:10,560
economy through i think they're called

2780
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:11,920
the i'm going to butcher that

2781
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:13,679
uh pronunciations like the doi moy

2782
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:14,960
reforms um through all of these

2783
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:16,400
referendums they did in terms of

2784
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,920
bringing their economy more in line with

2785
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:19,040
being more successful

2786
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:20,560
these have all involved the

2787
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:22,320
liberalization of their economy the

2788
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:23,040
association with other economies around

2789
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,480
the world

2790
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,840
and you could even see with some

2791
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,960
multilateral trade agreements like the

2792
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:28,880
tpp

2793
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:30,560
outside pressure was actually forcing

2794
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:32,480
vietnam to modernize on some of its

2795
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:33,920
labor rights the socialist party of that

2796
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:35,760
country was not able to do it on its own

2797
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:37,280
it needed some external association

2798
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:38,639
and we can see that within countries

2799
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,239
even socialist countries that they still

2800
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:41,760
have massive problems with some of their

2801
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:43,440
populations i mean we can point to the

2802
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:45,040
weaker situation that exists in china as

2803
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:45,679
an example of what is supposedly a

2804
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,280
socialist

2805
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:49,040
country having a huge problem dealing

2806
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:50,400
with uh you know uh

2807
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:53,440
equitable shares of how to treat people

2808
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:55,199
within its own borders

2809
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:56,560
all right final question to you uh

2810
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:58,480
professor wolf

2811
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:00,080
uh under your system of worker

2812
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:02,960
cooperatives would i still get my

2813
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:02,960
playstation 5

2814
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:07,280
absolutely you'd have to struggle a

2815
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:09,120
little bit for it you'd have to talk to

2816
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:11,280
your fellow workers you'd have to talk

2817
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:13,360
about the distribution of income

2818
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:14,400
you'd have to compare your desire for

2819
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:17,120
playstation

2820
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:18,560
uh against all the other interests of

2821
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:20,320
all the other people

2822
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:22,960
it wouldn't be something you worked out

2823
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:25,120
on your own with your particular boss

2824
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:27,760
in any way would have to be a democratic

2825
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:30,639
decision you'd have to come to terms

2826
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:32,239
with that the way you do with democratic

2827
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:35,440
decisions

2828
01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:38,080
now in our society to the extent uh

2829
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:39,280
that we have them uh and i would like to

2830
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:42,239
add only that

2831
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:44,400
if if steve is interested he could also

2832
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:47,120
look at the experience with covid

2833
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:48,000
uh that the cubans had because it is in

2834
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:49,760
many ways even

2835
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,600
better than the ones that the vietnamese

2836
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:53,840
had

2837
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:55,360
uh for the purposes of complete

2838
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:56,880
transparency i'm just going to state

2839
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,440
that that last question was actually my

2840
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,120
own

2841
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:00,880
and now i will move on to closing

2842
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:03,280
statements uh we'll begin

2843
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:04,080
uh with uh destiny and then we will end

2844
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:06,080
with richard wolff

2845
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:08,560
uh you have three minutes oh geez i

2846
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:11,199
didn't write a closing statement um

2847
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:12,960
so at the end of this i guess my

2848
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:14,400
important takeaway for all of this is i

2849
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:17,280
think that it is crucial

2850
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:18,800
not to moralize our economic systems i

2851
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:20,719
think that when you start to moralize

2852
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:22,560
economic systems what you forget

2853
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:24,800
is that an economic system is merely a

2854
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,800
tool um i don't want to ask a question

2855
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:27,679
of like is a hammer good or evil i want

2856
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,880
to ask you know like

2857
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:30,400
what is the best type of nail that you

2858
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:32,000
can hit with a particular hammer when

2859
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:33,840
you begin to point out whether or not a

2860
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,239
particular economic system is in and of

2861
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:36,000
itself

2862
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:37,520
good or evil then you lose sight of what

2863
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,520
economies are supposed to do which is

2864
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:41,280
efficiently allocate capital or natural

2865
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:42,560
resources in ways that make a country as

2866
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:44,000
prosperous as possible

2867
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,679
i do agree with richard wolff and

2868
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,960
probably with every socialist or every

2869
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:48,480
left-leaning person around the world

2870
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:49,840
that there are a ton of problems that

2871
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:51,679
exist in the western world and we're

2872
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:53,600
specifically in the united states today

2873
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:54,719
relating to things like inequality

2874
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:56,400
social justice

2875
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:58,320
a lack of access to things like health

2876
01:31:56,400 --> 01:32:00,639
care or education or

2877
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:02,400
basic things like food stamps or shelter

2878
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:04,159
or um

2879
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:06,320
or other like basic necessities i just

2880
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:07,920
don't see how a socialist society solves

2881
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:09,520
literally any of these things

2882
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:11,280
and i don't feel like i've ever been

2883
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:12,000
given an adequate explanation by any

2884
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,440
socialist

2885
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,920
for how they would organize their

2886
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:18,159
society usually these arguments are

2887
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:20,159
incredibly amorphous or vague such that

2888
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:21,600
literally everything is socialism like

2889
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:23,040
you can still have private enterprise

2890
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,880
and co-ops and the government does some

2891
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:26,800
things and voila that's socialism

2892
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:28,080
which just sounds like liberalism to me

2893
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:29,199
with government intervention which is

2894
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,800
liberalism

2895
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:32,480
or they try to make arguments for more

2896
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:33,840
strict forms of socialism

2897
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:35,520
but i think that it's hard to get them

2898
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:37,199
to admit that in those stricter forms of

2899
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,560
socialism they would disallow things

2900
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:40,080
like private investment

2901
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:42,239
and i guess it bothers me because so

2902
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:43,760
many innovations and things have existed

2903
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:44,159
only under the framework of capitalism

2904
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:45,840
that

2905
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:46,960
even with public research and public

2906
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:48,239
pushing you weren't able to get for

2907
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,960
instance i believe the led was

2908
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:51,600
discovered

2909
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:52,159
um or was invented in russia like 100

2910
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,520
years ago

2911
01:32:52,159 --> 01:32:54,880
and it wasn't until western private

2912
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,159
enterprise took a hold of that invention

2913
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:59,600
and started utilizing it then anybody

2914
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:59,600
was able to actually enjoy the invention

2915
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:02,719
all right thank you and now professor

2916
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,920
wolf closing statements your three

2917
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:06,880
minutes

2918
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:07,600
sure i think it's very hard for people

2919
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:10,480
to

2920
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:13,679
break out of the straitjacket that

2921
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:16,880
capitalism having existed for 300 years

2922
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:19,440
imposes on us often unconsciously

2923
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:20,560
often through the medium of our parents

2924
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:22,800
our teachers

2925
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:24,480
and so forth uh i respect that that's

2926
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,040
difficult human beings have a hard time

2927
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:28,800
doing that

2928
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:32,239
i'm included but i think that what is

2929
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:34,800
unique here is that all those

2930
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:36,639
problems of american capitalism that

2931
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:39,040
steve just listed

2932
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:40,800
the difference is whether you see those

2933
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:43,360
as distinct problems

2934
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:44,880
that you as a good liberal think that

2935
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:47,280
the government could address

2936
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:48,560
or that some institutional adjustment

2937
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,840
could address

2938
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:53,400
people who have looked at the

2939
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:57,040
inequalities the instability the

2940
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:59,840
injustices of capitalism

2941
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:00,480
have tried that for a long time and it

2942
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:02,800
doesn't

2943
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:04,239
work the fact of the matter is we have

2944
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:07,360
more inequality now

2945
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:09,520
than we had 10 40 and 60 years ago

2946
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:10,880
that's the system that we live in it's

2947
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:14,239
as though what the liberal

2948
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:15,840
does is look for every possible

2949
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:19,280
explanation

2950
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:20,239
other than that the basic system is the

2951
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:23,679
problem

2952
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:26,880
and system change is the solution

2953
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:27,840
and one last effort to clarify since it

2954
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:30,880
seems murky

2955
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:35,040
for steve the difference

2956
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:37,280
i advocate is a radical transformation

2957
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:39,360
of the workplace so that the person who

2958
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:43,199
comes to work is no longer

2959
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:45,760
overwhelmingly an employee a drone

2960
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:47,679
told where to sit and what to do with

2961
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:49,440
what machine on what occasion

2962
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:51,760
and then at the end of the day is told

2963
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:52,719
go home what happens to what you helped

2964
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:54,719
to produce

2965
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:56,239
is none of your business that

2966
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:58,840
transforming that

2967
01:34:56,239 --> 01:35:00,880
into a collective community that

2968
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:02,960
democratically decides

2969
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:04,080
so that every worker has two job

2970
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:07,239
descriptions

2971
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:08,560
the particular task and your equal

2972
01:35:07,239 --> 01:35:11,679
participation

2973
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:12,480
in running designing and organizing the

2974
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:15,280
enterprise

2975
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:16,960
that is a liberation of human capability

2976
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:19,600
it is a transformation

2977
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:21,760
of life from the bottom up and

2978
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:25,199
represents a kind of socialism

2979
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:26,880
which were it to be achieved would be a

2980
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:31,280
control on the government

2981
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:33,679
so it does what the people need and not

2982
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:34,719
get shifted off to other things that

2983
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:37,440
sustain

2984
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:38,159
the state as against the people that's a

2985
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:41,280
lesson

2986
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:43,199
learned from the earlier socialisms that

2987
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:45,760
the newer socialisms

2988
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:46,960
have incorporated the mass of people

2989
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:49,520
will determine

2990
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:51,040
as capitalism especially in the united

2991
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:54,320
states declines

2992
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:56,880
whether when and how to move

2993
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:59,520
forward but the yearning to do better

2994
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:02,320
than we're doing in u.s capitalism

2995
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:03,040
that's already a fact it's now only a

2996
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:05,760
question

2997
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:07,600
where it'll go the very fact that this

2998
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,760
conversation is happening

2999
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,880
and that someone like me was invited to

3000
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:14,159
participate

3001
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:16,080
is itself a sign of where things are

3002
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:17,280
going

3003
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:19,199
all right thank you so much for

3004
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:21,840
participating in this on both parts

3005
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:23,600
uh would either of you like to plug any

3006
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:26,960
of your current social projects

3007
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:31,040
or what you have going on

3008
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:32,880
um i'm good okay richard

3009
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:35,280
all i would say if anyone is interested

3010
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:38,320
in the kinds of things i have to say

3011
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:41,360
we maintain a website democracy at work

3012
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:42,960
dot info from there you can find

3013
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:45,920
everything that we do

3014
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:46,960
very simple all right thank you so much

3015
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:48,320
thanks everybody

3016
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:50,080
i don't know what to do so i ran into a

3017
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:52,080
similar problem with pogon because

3018
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:53,119
i think that wolf is like relatively

3019
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:55,920
polite

3020
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:56,880
um so i don't want to like cut him off

3021
01:36:55,920 --> 01:37:00,400
but like

3022
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:02,880
god damn when he just like

3023
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:03,840
so how do you feel about amazon well you

3024
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:06,800
see

3025
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:09,040
in 1823 when feudalism was a big part of

3026
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:12,400
the catholic church it's like

3027
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:14,480
oh my god stop why are we doing this

3028
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:15,760
how do we define when we talk about what

3029
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:17,199
a what a dog is

3030
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:18,960
we start off by saying that it's not a

3031
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:20,480
cat wait what

3032
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:22,000
there were so many things where i wanted

3033
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:23,440
to i i think i got a little bit more

3034
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,920
aggressive towards the end

3035
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:27,440
i was trying to be like more gentle in

3036
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:29,199
the beginning but then it felt like he

3037
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:31,199
was getting like fairly condescending

3038
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:34,719
but i don't want to like i don't want to

3039
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:37,199
cut him off because i don't know if um

3040
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:38,080
i don't know if that's like rude or not

3041
01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:39,920
um but then

3042
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:41,600
it felt like yeah i don't know i so i

3043
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,560
started to take a few more shots towards

3044
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:44,239
the last half

3045
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:45,840
but i hope i established that it was

3046
01:37:44,239 --> 01:37:46,639
because he was kind of starting it i

3047
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:48,400
don't know

3048
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:50,080
um he got super mad right after your

3049
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:51,840
initial statement yeah like right after

3050
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:55,520
my opening he's like uh

3051
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:58,080
socialism is i hate to admit this

3052
01:37:55,520 --> 01:38:00,320
i hope my mom's not in chat the the

3053
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:02,000
conservatives were right i guess

3054
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:03,840
socialism to people is just when the

3055
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:07,600
government does stuff i guess

3056
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:09,360
that was definition one um

3057
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:11,520
i didn't get to get to like any of my

3058
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:13,119
five challenges

3059
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:14,560
what level of violence is acceptable for

3060
01:38:13,119 --> 01:38:16,000
you to reach a social estate

3061
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:17,840
how do we decide which businesses are

3062
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,280
allowed to exist in a socialist society

3063
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:20,639
but it felt like he squirmed around a

3064
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:22,400
lot of these so like when i asked him

3065
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:23,760
because i asked him like so are you

3066
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:25,280
saying that like only

3067
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:27,119
um like only co-ops can exist in the

3068
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:28,639
studies well no but i'd like more co-ops

3069
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:30,000
than private firms because well how do

3070
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:33,119
you enforce that

3071
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,360
um oh and another thing that i hit on i

3072
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:36,960
might this might be exclusively how i

3073
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:38,880
debate lefties in the future

3074
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:40,719
um i think i'm just going to talk about

3075
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:42,320
capital markets because i feel like a

3076
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:44,080
lot of people in the left just don't

3077
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:46,159
know anything about the stock market

3078
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:47,679
which is a little bit surprising to me

3079
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:48,960
because if you're going to talk about or

3080
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:51,280
critique capitalism

3081
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:52,960
i feel like private equity markets or

3082
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:54,080
like financial markets or capital

3083
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:55,760
markets i feel like that's really

3084
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:57,280
important to understand

3085
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:58,880
it's like when you say things like well

3086
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:00,159
you know a corporation has no obligation

3087
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,880
to return the money to you like wait

3088
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:02,239
what do you mean

3089
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:05,199
why do you think they started paying

3090
01:39:02,239 --> 01:39:08,080
ceos in stock

3091
01:39:05,199 --> 01:39:09,679
instead of in actual cash we the whole

3092
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:11,119
point of this is because they want

3093
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:12,719
um the quote unquote owners of the

3094
01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:13,760
company to be maximizing returns for

3095
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:15,840
shareholders like

3096
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:16,960
i i think i think that i really do feel

3097
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,320
like in the future

3098
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:20,000
i think for lefties i think i'm just

3099
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:21,360
going to exclusively say hey let's talk

3100
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,159
about the stock market

3101
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:26,320
um most socialists don't understand

3102
01:39:24,159 --> 01:39:28,719
materials conditions yeah i just

3103
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:28,719
geez

3104
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:32,480
i felt that he was floundering in terms

3105
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:33,600
of investors yeah and then and then when

3106
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,560
he was like well i can point to hundreds

3107
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:35,760
of thousands of examples that doesn't

3108
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:38,560
happen oh yeah i'm sure

3109
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:39,840
i mean look at enron like of course

3110
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,040
there are going to be situations where

3111
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:43,360
people [ __ ] each other over yeah of

3112
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:43,360
course

3113
01:39:44,239 --> 01:39:47,600
the majority of c-level employees

3114
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:51,040
six-figure bonuses are all locked into

3115
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:51,040
stock for years yeah of course

3116
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:55,679
i think your complaining about feudalism

3117
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:56,800
was bad having a long historical

3118
01:39:55,679 --> 01:39:57,920
perspective on different ways of

3119
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,480
organizing society seems proper and

3120
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:59,520
relevant

3121
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:01,040
when talking about the possible

3122
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,520
evolution from one economic one complex

3123
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:04,080
economics

3124
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:04,719
well so technically oh god i hate to do

3125
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:06,480
this okay

3126
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:08,080
i hate to i hate to debate bro you here

3127
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,719
but i'm gonna use one debate bro term

3128
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:11,119
okay

3129
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:12,639
it is fallacious to say that because we

3130
01:40:11,119 --> 01:40:13,520
came from one system and we're going

3131
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:15,040
somewhere else

3132
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:16,880
necessarily means we're going to go from

3133
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:19,840
this system to the next and

3134
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:21,119
even if i did grant that causality even

3135
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:22,000
even if i did say because here is the

3136
01:40:21,119 --> 01:40:24,400
argument he's making

3137
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,520
we went from a to b and then from b to c

3138
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:27,199
and then from c to d

3139
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:29,760
now we're definitely gonna go from d to

3140
01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:30,400
e even if i did grant that dde is going

3141
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:32,000
to happen

3142
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:33,520
there's no conclusion there's no reason

3143
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,360
to believe that e is socialism

3144
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:37,040
e could just as easily be a fascist

3145
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:39,199
state e could just as easily be a

3146
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:41,360
post-nuclear war a post-apocalyptic

3147
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:43,199
anarcho capitalist anarcho communist

3148
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:45,119
anarcho syndactylus whatever

3149
01:40:43,199 --> 01:40:46,400
society right he could be anything right

3150
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:49,840
so that that

3151
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:51,280
whole line of of speaking is hey

3152
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:52,400
i try to avoid debate bro terms and

3153
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:53,360
right but it's fallacious it doesn't

3154
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:55,679
make any sense

3155
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:57,440
um it is a non-sequitur it doesn't

3156
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:58,880
logically follow that because we went

3157
01:40:57,440 --> 01:41:00,400
from a to b b to c c to d

3158
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:01,520
therefore we are definitely going to go

3159
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:02,480
from d to e that needs to be

3160
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:04,800
demonstrated

3161
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:05,520
and what e is e could be socialism or

3162
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:07,119
any number

3163
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:08,639
on the any other number of systems that

3164
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:09,920
also needs to be demonstrated that

3165
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:11,199
argument in and of itself is not

3166
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:12,960
compelling sorry [ __ ]

3167
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:14,560
i didn't even get to i didn't get to

3168
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:18,080
address that but um

3169
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:20,080
yeah why did you say history

3170
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:21,760
isn't relevant because i didn't like the

3171
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:23,520
fact that when he was condemning the

3172
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:25,199
actions of the democratic party he

3173
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:26,480
wanted to reach back over a hundred

3174
01:41:25,199 --> 01:41:27,520
years and talk about their failures but

3175
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:29,280
when i was trying to get him to tell me

3176
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:30,400
what he believed a socialist country was

3177
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:31,920
or what socialism was

3178
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:33,440
he was like well hold on i'm not going

3179
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:34,159
by marx's definition things are

3180
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,440
different now

3181
01:41:34,159 --> 01:41:36,400
well hold on if things are going to be

3182
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:38,320
different now for how you define

3183
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:39,199
socialism which by the way that's fair

3184
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,800
if you want to use the international

3185
01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:42,480
definition now that's fine but you can't

3186
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:44,000
hold the democratic party to account for

3187
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:45,360
things that another democratic party did

3188
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,320
100 years ago i don't think that's fair

3189
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,679
i don't think you can do that

3190
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,719
you have to be consistent in this if you

3191
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:49,920
want to talk about how things are as

3192
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:51,360
they are now that's fine

3193
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:53,040
but if you're if you're um if your

3194
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:55,360
definition of social is going to be so

3195
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:57,440
wide to include private and this is

3196
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:58,960
another thing that bothered me but

3197
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:01,520
i feel like he never actually gave me a

3198
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:03,360
definition of capitalism either

3199
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:04,960
my definition of capitalism or what i

3200
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:07,119
understand capitalism to be

3201
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:08,719
capitalism is when you have private

3202
01:42:07,119 --> 01:42:09,280
enterprise meaning you've got people

3203
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:10,719
that can

3204
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:12,480
own companies that don't necessarily

3205
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:14,239
work them and then they interact with

3206
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,719
some free market or open market system

3207
01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:16,480
that's what

3208
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:18,159
that's how capitalism is it means that i

3209
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:19,360
can go out and buy a business hire other

3210
01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:20,719
people to work it and then i can buy and

3211
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,760
sell goods on an open market

3212
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:24,480
like that's it that's all that's what

3213
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:25,920
capitalism is but it feels like um

3214
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:27,520
it feels like he wants to like load

3215
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:29,199
things like

3216
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:30,400
capitalism is when the slave and the

3217
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:31,600
master when you have the employee and

3218
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,880
the player and the ownership and the

3219
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:34,000
extraction of limits like damn just

3220
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,199
let's just like let's just go by

3221
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,239
basically so we know what the [ __ ] we're

3222
01:42:35,199 --> 01:42:37,520
talking about because

3223
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:38,719
and then his idea of like well i'm not

3224
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:40,159
going to tell you what capitalism is the

3225
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:41,119
way that we work on definitions is by

3226
01:42:40,159 --> 01:42:42,320
saying what they're not

3227
01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:43,520
and it's like wait what i thought my

3228
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:44,159
jeopardy equip was good do you think it

3229
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:45,840
was good

3230
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:47,119
i'm trying not to i try to do as many

3231
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,719
quips but man it felt like he was

3232
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:50,320
getting really angry so i wanted to

3233
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:52,000
i had to start quipping i had to start

3234
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:55,440
equipping he was quipping on me

3235
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,440
um yeah [ __ ] i don't know

3236
01:42:55,760 --> 01:43:01,679
i you lazyballed that bezos answer you

3237
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:03,040
answered that much better in the past

3238
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:03,520
well i asked the question again he

3239
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:05,119
didn't even

3240
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:06,719
he didn't even remember the question i

3241
01:43:05,119 --> 01:43:08,080
hope that stuck with the audience

3242
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:09,440
i don't know if the audience is keeping

3243
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,880
track of things as well as i am mentally

3244
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:12,239
i tried to restate it but i asked him

3245
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:13,520
the bezos question and then he talked

3246
01:43:12,239 --> 01:43:15,840
for two minutes and i asked him what the

3247
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:18,000
question was and he didn't even remember

3248
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:19,119
and then i had to ask him again and then

3249
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:25,840
he moralized it

3250
01:43:19,119 --> 01:43:25,840
he's like wow like jesus

3251
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:31,520
destiny the difference is ontologically

3252
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:33,520
prior to identity but wolf was still

3253
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:35,119
being a dodging dumb [ __ ] okay sure but

3254
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:36,000
we're not having debates on ontology

3255
01:43:35,119 --> 01:43:38,239
here okay

3256
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,040
i believe that when most people ask like

3257
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:42,400
hey dude

3258
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:44,080
what's that like oh that

3259
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:46,080
well it's not a wall it's not the color

3260
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:47,679
blue um it's not a light

3261
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:49,440
uh it's not an economy it's not like

3262
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:50,400
wait hold on wait we just

3263
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:52,480
tell me what you think this thing what

3264
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:54,400
do you mean like

3265
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:55,760
if we were having like categorical like

3266
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:57,280
discussions or or

3267
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:58,480
or talking about like the nature of

3268
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:58,960
something we were having an ontological

3269
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:00,159
debate

3270
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:01,360
we could do that but that was not the

3271
01:44:00,159 --> 01:44:02,960
level of discourse we were at here

3272
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:04,639
that's not what we were talking about

3273
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:06,159
you need to add like 10 more nebraska

3274
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:07,760
steve i tried to get more snarky towards

3275
01:44:06,159 --> 01:44:09,920
the end because it felt like

3276
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:11,199
yeah [ __ ] i don't know i feel like this

3277
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:13,280
is going to sound really weird

3278
01:44:11,199 --> 01:44:14,800
but i feel like having an unmoderated

3279
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,360
in-person debate with him would be a lot

3280
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,199
of fun

3281
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:18,560
is he from new york the way that he

3282
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:20,400
talks strikes me as somebody from the

3283
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:21,679
east coast and i i think those

3284
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:23,119
i like people like that because he seems

3285
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:24,639
like he seems like he would be more

3286
01:44:23,119 --> 01:44:25,280
combative which would be a lot of fun i

3287
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:29,040
think

3288
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:32,800
um but um yeah [ __ ]

3289
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:32,800
oh massachusetts okay yeah close enough

3290
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:36,239
also destiny why is it wrong in your

3291
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:37,119
opinion to moralize an economic system

3292
01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:39,360
sure

3293
01:44:37,119 --> 01:44:40,639
so the reason why it's bad to moralize

3294
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:43,760
an economic system

3295
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:46,800
is because people pretend like what we

3296
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:49,360
want exists in the economic system

3297
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:51,040
but that's not true what we want comes

3298
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:53,119
after the economic system

3299
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:55,119
we don't care about what happens within

3300
01:44:53,119 --> 01:44:56,719
an economy what we care about is at the

3301
01:44:55,119 --> 01:44:57,520
end what the distribution of goods and

3302
01:44:56,719 --> 01:44:59,360
services are

3303
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:00,960
so here's an example of this let's say

3304
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:02,719
that we have an economy where the worker

3305
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:03,840
and the owner can only earn two times as

3306
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:05,280
much as each other and everything is

3307
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:06,800
equitably split out and blah blah blah

3308
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,520
blah and let's say that society is poor

3309
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,040
and starving

3310
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:10,639
would we prefer that or would we prefer

3311
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,920
a society with massive inequality where

3312
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:13,040
the poorest people you know can eat

3313
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:13,440
steak dinners every night it's like

3314
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,880
right

3315
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:16,320
well okay well obviously we prefer the

3316
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:17,920
latter rather than the former and the

3317
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:19,040
reason why is because we're not really

3318
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:20,320
we shouldn't be moralizing the

3319
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:21,840
relationships that exist within an

3320
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:23,119
economic system we should be looking at

3321
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:24,800
the outcomes that they produce after

3322
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:25,920
economic systems are just tools

3323
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:28,000
that are supposed to be wielded by

3324
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:29,679
policy makers in order to ensure a more

3325
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:33,840
fair distribution at the end of the day

3326
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:36,000
now that being said it might be the case

3327
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:37,679
it might be the case that a socialist

3328
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,880
form of organization achieves more

3329
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:41,679
equitable outcomes

3330
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:43,360
however if that is the case we should be

3331
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:44,080
arguing about the outcomes produced by

3332
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:45,760
that system

3333
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:48,719
not the inherent relationships within

3334
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:50,000
that system right

3335
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:51,600
um do you have a preference between a

3336
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,239
profitable system with or without any

3337
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:54,400
quality

3338
01:45:52,239 --> 01:45:56,080
if you had two separate systems and they

3339
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:57,119
produced the exact same amount of wealth

3340
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:58,719
at the end of the day

3341
01:45:57,119 --> 01:46:00,080
then getting one system that is more

3342
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:01,199
equitable within that system would

3343
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:04,480
probably be better it would make things

3344
01:46:01,199 --> 01:46:06,159
easier for policy makers right

3345
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:07,520
the content of the relationship implies

3346
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:07,840
something about the outcome missing the

3347
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:09,520
point

3348
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:11,119
no you're wrong you're just wrong i'm

3349
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:12,480
sorry but you're just wrong

3350
01:46:11,119 --> 01:46:14,639
isn't half the point of socialism to

3351
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:15,600
actually um create something ethical

3352
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:17,520
inside the system i

3353
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:18,960
removing alienation of workers and such

3354
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:20,560
alienation of workers and all of that

3355
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:22,400
can be achieved within socialism and can

3356
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:24,320
be achieved within capitalism it depends

3357
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:25,600
you can feel alienated in a labor union

3358
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,400
you could feel alienated in a private

3359
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:28,719
place to work

3360
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:30,000
there are probably some people that feel

3361
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:31,040
like they have more control over their

3362
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,320
job when they work for places like

3363
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:33,840
amazon or facebook where you're given

3364
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:35,360
some degree of freedom or flexibility

3365
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:36,800
over the projects you choose to work on

3366
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:38,800
then there are some people that work

3367
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:40,239
inside labor unions that constantly vote

3368
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:41,679
against what they personally would want

3369
01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:43,280
i mean like we can imagine these types

3370
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:44,800
of conditions existing everywhere we can

3371
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:46,400
also imagine we don't have to imagine if

3372
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:48,080
we want to talk historical examples we

3373
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:49,520
can go back to like the 50s and 60s we

3374
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:51,280
can look where labor unions will vote to

3375
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:51,840
disenfranchise minority swathes of their

3376
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:52,960
membership

3377
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:54,880
it took the federal government and the

3378
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:56,960
civil rights age coming in and actually

3379
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:58,320
enforcing externally onto labor unions

3380
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:59,840
worker-controlled unions

3381
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:01,679
um things like equal rights or things

3382
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:03,280
like civil rights because a lot of the

3383
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:05,199
white majority owning people in those

3384
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:06,639
unions the the runners of that union

3385
01:47:05,199 --> 01:47:07,920
even with the votes of the minority

3386
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:09,280
black people still weren't able to

3387
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:11,199
achieve equitable conditions for those

3388
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:13,119
black workers

3389
01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:15,840
again i'm not blaming the union or the

3390
01:47:13,119 --> 01:47:17,679
system capitalism can reinforce racism

3391
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:19,600
uh socialism can reinforce racism

3392
01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:20,960
capitalism can also do things reinforce

3393
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:22,480
anti-racism and socialism could

3394
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:24,560
reinforce anti-racism

3395
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:26,239
right now in our society there seems to

3396
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:28,320
be in the past

3397
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:29,679
50 years ago it seems to be the case

3398
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:30,960
that there was a price tag for being

3399
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:31,600
somewhat bigoted for being somewhat

3400
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:33,520
racist

3401
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:34,800
if you made movies or film or if you had

3402
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:35,360
businesses that didn't serve black

3403
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,960
people

3404
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:38,560
that didn't showcase uh gay

3405
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:39,840
relationships et cetera et cetera there

3406
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:41,280
was a reward for that in the economy

3407
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:42,719
you're rewarded for being racist you

3408
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:44,159
were rewarded for being homophobic you

3409
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:46,080
were rewarded for being bigoted

3410
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:47,760
nowadays in society it seems as though

3411
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:48,800
that's somewhat flipped now the rewards

3412
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:50,719
exist for being

3413
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:52,159
you know more woke the worker you are as

3414
01:47:50,719 --> 01:47:53,360
a company the more you advertise that

3415
01:47:52,159 --> 01:47:54,639
sometimes the more money you can make

3416
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:56,159
doing so if you make a hollywood film

3417
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:57,840
today that has more black people more

3418
01:47:56,159 --> 01:47:59,280
women you widen your audience right you

3419
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:00,560
widen your markets here look at how

3420
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:01,840
popular like the black panther was

3421
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:03,360
nobody saw that movie earning i think it

3422
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:05,920
grossed over a billion dollars right

3423
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:06,719
um now i'm not saying now to be clear

3424
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:08,320
again

3425
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:10,480
i'm not saying like look capitalism

3426
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:11,119
solved racism all i'm trying to bring

3427
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:12,880
all i wanna

3428
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:14,719
if i can bring anybody on board with

3429
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:17,199
anything at the end of the day

3430
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:18,560
okay if i could bring anybody on board

3431
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:19,840
with anything in the day here is all i

3432
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:22,480
want you to do just stop

3433
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:23,280
thinking of tools as being moral or

3434
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:25,440
immoral

3435
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:26,880
okay there's no reason to assume that by

3436
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:28,480
adding a small amount of your labor to

3437
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,119
some capital that you now own that

3438
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:30,960
capital

3439
01:48:29,119 --> 01:48:32,239
any more than the capital adding his cap

3440
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:33,520
now the capital is adding his capital

3441
01:48:32,239 --> 01:48:34,960
labor owns your labor

3442
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:36,639
right these relationships aren't

3443
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:38,159
inherently moral or immoral we should be

3444
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:39,840
concerned about the material conditions

3445
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:42,239
that exist at the end of the day

3446
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:43,679
okay economies or economic organizations

3447
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:46,000
or economic policies

3448
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:48,000
should only be policies that are wielded

3449
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,440
as tools by policymakers

3450
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,040
we shouldn't look at these relationships

3451
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:52,080
as inherently moral or immoral we need

3452
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:53,119
to look at the outcomes that these

3453
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,320
systems produce

3454
01:48:53,119 --> 01:48:55,440
that's all that's all i want to bring

3455
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:56,880
you on board with and if you still think

3456
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:58,239
that like well i think socialism makes

3457
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:00,320
better outcomes than capitalism

3458
01:48:58,239 --> 01:49:01,600
okay fine we can argue about that sure

3459
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:02,639
and in some limited cases

3460
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:04,080
you know you might be right or maybe

3461
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:05,119
even a wider case you might be right you

3462
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:06,880
know maybe you can point to

3463
01:49:05,119 --> 01:49:08,080
the idea that people getting to vote um

3464
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:09,360
you know when some companies you know

3465
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:10,400
feel you know better about the way that

3466
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:12,560
things run you know my

3467
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:14,400
fiancee's dad in sweden um he lives in

3468
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:15,679
like a uh like a co-op

3469
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,800
is like the type of apartment he lives

3470
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:18,000
in my understanding is that those are

3471
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:19,679
pretty popular in sweden

3472
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,960
where you move into a building and you

3473
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:22,159
buy a share in that building and then

3474
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:23,280
you live in it you get to vote on like

3475
01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:24,000
the changes that happen in that building

3476
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:25,199
and apparently

3477
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,960
a lot of people in sweden that really

3478
01:49:25,199 --> 01:49:28,320
like that organization you know um you

3479
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:29,440
know and that type of co-op where you

3480
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:30,719
actually control where you live you know

3481
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:31,840
maybe having voting power there is

3482
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:32,239
important maybe i need to choose that

3483
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:33,760
right

3484
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:35,360
all i'm saying is that just don't look

3485
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:36,719
at like these economic tools

3486
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:38,400
which are just tools don't look at them

3487
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:39,360
it's inherently morally immoral because

3488
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:41,920
what happens is

3489
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:43,840
is when it warps your [ __ ] brain it

3490
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:44,320
leads you to saying some things that are

3491
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:46,639
actually

3492
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:47,679
create bad outcomes like something that

3493
01:49:46,639 --> 01:49:49,520
you might consider

3494
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:51,760
like a more inherently moral

3495
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:53,920
relationship might get you to a worse

3496
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:56,719
outcome which is something we don't want

3497
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:57,599
right um for instance if we give workers

3498
01:49:56,719 --> 01:49:58,800
so like here's

3499
01:49:57,599 --> 01:50:00,880
i can give you a hypothetical railroad

3500
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:02,400
example if we give workers autonomy over

3501
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:04,080
their workplace it might be the case

3502
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:04,639
that workers that work in a fossil fuel

3503
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:06,400
industry

3504
01:50:04,639 --> 01:50:07,760
will massively vote to overproduce

3505
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,320
fossil fuels they might massively

3506
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:09,520
promote

3507
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:10,480
to increase production because they're

3508
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,920
protecting their own industry they're

3509
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:13,360
protecting their own jobs

3510
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:14,719
now before somebody says oh well nobody

3511
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:16,320
would ever do that you can look in

3512
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:18,000
places like california

3513
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:19,599
where there are labor unions that

3514
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,440
constantly fight against the turning on

3515
01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:22,560
of massive solar arrays here because you

3516
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:23,920
know they don't want their jobs to be

3517
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,280
threatened you can look at places you

3518
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:26,320
can look at a federation of unions the

3519
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:27,440
largest one in the united states the

3520
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:29,040
afl-cio

3521
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:30,000
you know has a position against the

3522
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:30,880
green new deal because they don't

3523
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,320
believe that the green new deal

3524
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:34,159
adequately takes into concerns

3525
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:35,360
uh or takes into its concern the concern

3526
01:50:34,159 --> 01:50:37,520
of the workers that exist within their

3527
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:39,440
unions you know

3528
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:40,960
just don't moralize just don't moralize

3529
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:42,480
your economic system it just leads you

3530
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:44,560
to um

3531
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:46,159
it just it poisons your brain it gives

3532
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:47,280
you it it clouds your judgment and it

3533
01:50:46,159 --> 01:50:48,560
gives you an inability to

3534
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:53,840
analyze these problems and give you good

3535
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:53,840
prescriptions is my problem

3536
01:51:00,239 --> 01:51:03,840
why didn't you open with this moralizing

3537
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:05,280
argument um i tried to but

3538
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:06,719
the problem is that like any time i

3539
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:08,159
asked him any question about anything it

3540
01:51:06,719 --> 01:51:10,080
felt like um

3541
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:11,199
i don't i don't feel like my debate

3542
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,840
would poke it it felt like he didn't

3543
01:51:11,199 --> 01:51:13,360
make like he'd

3544
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:15,360
never wanted to make like a concrete

3545
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:17,119
point or argument it's hard for me to

3546
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:18,639
tell i try to be generous to my

3547
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:20,000
people that i my interlocutors i try to

3548
01:51:18,639 --> 01:51:21,360
be generous and say maybe i'm not

3549
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:24,480
understanding something

3550
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:25,679
um maybe i'm just missing something

3551
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:27,119
but i feel like i'm reasonably

3552
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:28,880
intelligent and i feel like i have a

3553
01:51:27,119 --> 01:51:30,239
decent grasp of these topics if it feels

3554
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:32,239
like you're dancing around in circles

3555
01:51:30,239 --> 01:51:32,880
and it takes you so long to answer any

3556
01:51:32,239 --> 01:51:34,320
question

3557
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:35,599
like if i just ask questions like what

3558
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:36,880
is capitalism to you you're like what is

3559
01:51:35,599 --> 01:51:38,400
socialism like can you give me and you

3560
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:40,000
have to talk for three minutes and it's

3561
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:41,520
like a 200 year long answer like i don't

3562
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,960
know it feels to me like

3563
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:44,719
it feels like a bit of obfuscation is

3564
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:46,239
occurring or rather

3565
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:47,520
like if i i don't want to go the bad

3566
01:51:46,239 --> 01:51:48,080
faith route but maybe they do this

3567
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,679
unintentionally

3568
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:51,599
what it feels like this is what it feels

3569
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:52,639
like to me it feels like you're scared

3570
01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:54,639
of giving me

3571
01:51:52,639 --> 01:51:56,159
a concrete definition because you know

3572
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:57,679
that any definition that you give is

3573
01:51:56,159 --> 01:51:58,800
going to be inadequate and that you can

3574
01:51:57,679 --> 01:52:01,199
be attacked on it

3575
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:02,320
um maybe and maybe i should be maybe i

3576
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:04,000
need to find a way to put me on the

3577
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:05,280
defense more on my things

3578
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,560
because the frustrating is if you would

3579
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:07,679
ask me to define anything i tried this

3580
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:08,719
at one point of the debate but then

3581
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:11,119
wolfe ran from it

3582
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:13,440
um it was over the bezos thing i can

3583
01:52:11,119 --> 01:52:15,360
tell you exactly why a ceo gets paid

3584
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:15,760
what they do and i can tell you exactly

3585
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,920
why

3586
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:19,040
any worker gets paid what they do right

3587
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:21,040
we can talk about like

3588
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:22,480
the marginal cost that the next unit for

3589
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:23,679
the marginal cost of labor going into

3590
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:24,960
the next unit the marginal cost of a

3591
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:26,400
product or we can talk about

3592
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:27,679
supply and demand of different types of

3593
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:28,880
talents in the workplace i can give you

3594
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:30,719
exact answers i don't have to

3595
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:32,000
i don't have to talk for about 200 years

3596
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:32,639
ago you know somebody said this and

3597
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,080
that's why i

3598
01:52:32,639 --> 01:52:35,119
can give you exactness all of these i

3599
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,560
feel like you should be able to do the

3600
01:52:35,119 --> 01:52:37,920
same for for any explanation that you're

3601
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:39,199
giving you know

3602
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:40,480
the three card game he played with the

3603
01:52:39,199 --> 01:52:41,840
three definitions of socialism was

3604
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:43,199
amazing he claimed that portugal was

3605
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:44,400
socialist so socialism works but he

3606
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:44,800
advocated for the third form not the

3607
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:47,040
first

3608
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:48,239
yeah it reminds me of when unlearning

3609
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:50,000
economics was saying like

3610
01:52:48,239 --> 01:52:51,280
oh well 15 an hour minimum wage can be

3611
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,400
good here's all these studies that say

3612
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:56,560
twelve dollar minimum age just

3613
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:56,560
minimum wage is possible it's like okay

3614
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:59,840
uh

3615
01:53:00,159 --> 01:53:03,280
could you elaborate on why you didn't

3616
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:05,119
consider vietnam's response to covid

3617
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:06,719
um i because i've heard varying things

3618
01:53:05,119 --> 01:53:07,920
about like the southeast asian region in

3619
01:53:06,719 --> 01:53:08,719
terms of like whether or not they under

3620
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:09,679
report like

3621
01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:10,880
because i've heard people claim that

3622
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:12,320
china underreported the amount of

3623
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:13,760
sickness i haven't heard that claim

3624
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:15,119
regarding to vietnam

3625
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:16,639
but i just haven't looked into it enough

3626
01:53:15,119 --> 01:53:17,920
and i have other very concrete countries

3627
01:53:16,639 --> 01:53:18,560
where i trust the data that comes out of

3628
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:19,840
them

3629
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:20,639
and the three that i typically look at

3630
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:22,000
are south korea and new zealand

3631
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:23,360
australia for like how effective are

3632
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,880
lockdowns um and then i'm kind of

3633
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:26,480
familiar with like how western countries

3634
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:27,760
dealt with things um

3635
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:29,199
roughly mainly like the uk and the

3636
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:32,320
united states but i just haven't looked

3637
01:53:29,199 --> 01:53:32,320
into vietnam that much in terms of the

3638
01:53:39,679 --> 01:53:41,679
i coronavirus like you're saying things

3639
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:43,040
like you may be misunderstanding made

3640
01:53:41,679 --> 01:53:44,159
you look bad did i say that a lot during

3641
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:46,320
the debate i tried to cut that

3642
01:53:44,159 --> 01:53:48,080
down um because i said that a lot during

3643
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:49,199
pogam i try that to be um

3644
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:50,560
generous to my opponent but i think

3645
01:53:49,199 --> 01:53:52,000
rhetorically i don't think it plays well

3646
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:53,199
i tried not to do that as much as i like

3647
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,599
oh maybe i don't understand it no i

3648
01:53:53,199 --> 01:53:57,119
think i did say it a couple times

3649
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:58,719
yeah i should just i should just not say

3650
01:53:57,119 --> 01:54:00,880
that ever because it's

3651
01:53:58,719 --> 01:54:02,159
because [ __ ] i feel like i'm i'm trying

3652
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:03,040
to be humble i'm trying to show some

3653
01:54:02,159 --> 01:54:05,040
respect

3654
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:06,800
but i really shouldn't uh august pointed

3655
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:08,000
this out what i should be saying instead

3656
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:09,280
of like i don't really understand

3657
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,320
what you mean this year you what i

3658
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:11,760
should be saying is you haven't

3659
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:13,280
adequately demonstrated this can you

3660
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:14,080
explain this again that's what i should

3661
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:18,320
be doing

3662
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:19,840
um because that's actually true yeah

3663
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:20,880
i wonder if opening within all socialist

3664
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:22,560
countries have failed put some on the

3665
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:23,679
back foot right again i feel like i have

3666
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:26,320
that several times in my opening

3667
01:54:23,679 --> 01:54:26,320
statement but

3668
01:54:30,639 --> 01:54:33,840
in the past you've said clearly that

3669
01:54:32,159 --> 01:54:35,840
stocks are gambling yet you seem to

3670
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:37,199
define it as specifically receiving ri

3671
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:39,840
you're betting a lot of money on an

3672
01:54:37,199 --> 01:54:41,360
individual stock is gambling of course

3673
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:42,719
but that is not at all even remotely

3674
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:46,080
related to anything i've said in this

3675
01:54:42,719 --> 01:54:46,080
conversation so i don't know why

3676
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:52,080
also like [ __ ] i dude i should focus on

3677
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:54,480
capital markets

3678
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:55,840
um i see this idiot uh matt cletch or

3679
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,239
whatever i see this dumb [ __ ] tweeting

3680
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:57,840
too

3681
01:54:56,239 --> 01:54:59,440
um jeff bezos is worth 200 billion

3682
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:00,960
because of his skills well okay

3683
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:02,400
well let's say that instead of jeff

3684
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:04,080
bezos being worth money let's say that

3685
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:04,800
we distribute all of that in stock to

3686
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:06,239
the employees

3687
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:07,840
well what are the employees going to do

3688
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:08,639
with it right they're probably going to

3689
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:09,920
sell the stock

3690
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:11,440
so let's say that the employees sell the

3691
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:12,880
stock to earn some money now instead of

3692
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:14,159
conversation well well now you have a

3693
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:14,800
bunch of employees that work for amazon

3694
01:55:14,159 --> 01:55:17,280
that don't own any

3695
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:18,719
stock like you can't get food with stock

3696
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:19,840
let's follow that to its logical

3697
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:21,119
conclusion like what would that even

3698
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:24,320
mean like how would you even like

3699
01:55:21,119 --> 01:55:26,320
i don't know or i get well

3700
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:27,679
actually there are answers to this i

3701
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:29,119
don't want to give them though because i

3702
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:30,719
don't think lefties understand capital

3703
01:55:29,119 --> 01:55:32,400
markets enough to know what the answers

3704
01:55:30,719 --> 01:55:34,960
would be um

3705
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:37,280
rage poke there we can think we could

3706
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:38,080
probably invent some stock schemes to

3707
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:39,520
make it work

3708
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:40,880
so like you would distribute stock and

3709
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:41,840
then you would do a stock split maybe

3710
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:43,119
every two weeks

3711
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:44,320
and then the stock split would be a way

3712
01:55:43,119 --> 01:55:45,280
of employees getting paid out and then

3713
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:46,960
you would like combine this with

3714
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:48,480
buybacks strategically in order to

3715
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:50,159
they're like we could probably think of

3716
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:51,920
like complicated stock schemes

3717
01:55:50,159 --> 01:55:53,360
in order to do this but like why if you

3718
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:54,560
really want to do this like an employee

3719
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:55,440
could just buy stock with their wage

3720
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:59,520
right like yeah

3721
01:55:55,440 --> 01:56:00,880
but i but yeah i don't know [ __ ]

3722
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:02,560
we need to talk about capital markets

3723
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:05,040
way more with lefties because i truly

3724
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:06,480
believe that um

3725
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:09,040
i truly believe that they just don't

3726
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:09,040
understand

3727
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:15,840
anything about capital markets

3728
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:25,360
is there a real reason why bezos having

3729
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:27,119
that much money is bad

3730
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:29,199
um well so to be i know you put money in

3731
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:30,239
quotes him having the money isn't bad or

3732
01:56:29,199 --> 01:56:31,199
him having ownership in the company

3733
01:56:30,239 --> 01:56:33,440
isn't bad the bad

3734
01:56:31,199 --> 01:56:35,040
thing is the unequitable distribution

3735
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:36,159
well no not even really what kind of the

3736
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:36,639
unequitable distribution of wealth of

3737
01:56:36,159 --> 01:56:38,560
society

3738
01:56:36,639 --> 01:56:40,320
the bad thing is that we have some

3739
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:41,199
people in society that have an immense

3740
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,800
amount of wealth

3741
01:56:41,199 --> 01:56:44,480
and then we have some people in society

3742
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:45,520
that are immensely [ __ ] if you want to

3743
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:46,080
see things like this play out in the

3744
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:47,679
real world

3745
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:49,280
like go to san francisco it's one of the

3746
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:50,560
most mind-blowing places in the world

3747
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:51,199
you can walk down the street from

3748
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,480
businesses

3749
01:56:51,199 --> 01:56:54,320
that are worth hundreds of millions of

3750
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:55,920
dollars and see poor people like begging

3751
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:56,960
for food outside of a starbucks

3752
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:58,719
something is like

3753
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:00,880
terminally broken in that system

3754
01:56:58,719 --> 01:57:02,320
something is severely [ __ ] there

3755
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:04,000
so when you have some people that seem

3756
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:05,280
to have amassed so much wealth that they

3757
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,320
couldn't spend it over the course of a

3758
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:07,280
hundred lifetimes

3759
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:08,800
and then you have other people that are

3760
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:10,239
homeless well it seems like we have a

3761
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:12,800
problem that we have an equity

3762
01:57:10,239 --> 01:57:14,320
problem there but hey i mean like these

3763
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:14,880
problems have existed socialist regimes

3764
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:17,599
too you know

3765
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:18,400
soviet soldiers uh soldiers soviet

3766
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:20,239
soldiers

3767
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:21,440
shot ukrainians that were running away

3768
01:57:20,239 --> 01:57:22,639
trying to find food so they didn't have

3769
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:23,040
to eat their [ __ ] family members

3770
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:26,080
during the

3771
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:28,000
of demore um china right now is has over

3772
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:29,599
800 000 uyghurs in detention camps

3773
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:31,440
trying to culturally genocide them

3774
01:57:29,599 --> 01:57:32,719
um you know vietnam has had its share of

3775
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:33,599
problems under a single-party system

3776
01:57:32,719 --> 01:57:35,199
like a ton of like

3777
01:57:33,599 --> 01:57:36,800
socialist countries have problems too

3778
01:57:35,199 --> 01:57:38,400
and the imperialist thing was so stupid

3779
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:39,679
as well the ussr was an incredibly

3780
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:42,159
imperialist regime

3781
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:43,760
cuba venezuela bolivia like all of these

3782
01:57:42,159 --> 01:57:45,199
like socialist countries have also had i

3783
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:46,480
don't know if i'd say balloon but all

3784
01:57:45,199 --> 01:57:47,199
these countries have had like severe or

3785
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:48,800
known yeah

3786
01:57:47,199 --> 01:57:50,000
have had like severe imperialist things

3787
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:51,280
going on as well like the idea that

3788
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,560
imperialism is somehow unique to

3789
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:53,199
capitalists or unique to western

3790
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:55,920
countries

3791
01:57:53,199 --> 01:57:56,800
or even a unique like countries have

3792
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:58,080
been imperialists throughout all of

3793
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:59,840
human history like tons of people have

3794
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:01,119
invaded people for natural resources and

3795
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:02,880
et cetera et cetera et cetera and even

3796
01:58:01,119 --> 01:58:04,800
mondragon you know relies on contract

3797
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:06,159
labor from south america and from africa

3798
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:08,880
again people have criticized mandarin

3799
01:58:06,159 --> 01:58:08,880
for relying on this

3800
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:18,960
one quip that i thought of um that i

3801
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:20,800
didn't say because i feel like it would

3802
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:22,800
have been way too pointed was

3803
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:24,719
when uh when wolf said that world war ii

3804
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:26,159
started because of capitalist powers

3805
01:58:24,719 --> 01:58:28,000
what i wanted to chime in there and say

3806
01:58:26,159 --> 01:58:29,440
well at least you're consistent about

3807
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:31,440
not wanting the u.s to come in and stop

3808
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:32,000
genocides but i felt like that would

3809
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:33,360
have been

3810
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:35,040
way too i feel like that would have been

3811
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:37,920
way too aggressive so i

3812
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:37,920
held that one back

3813
01:58:44,159 --> 01:58:46,560
this is the problem disentangle the

3814
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:49,840
politics from the economics of

3815
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:49,840
capitalism people conflate the two

3816
01:58:57,599 --> 01:59:03,840
and he corrected me on this on the

3817
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:03,840
pronunciation of mondragon

3818
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:14,320
yeah and then i i don't know i don't

3819
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:14,800
know if it counted as a rhetorical win

3820
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:16,000
but when

3821
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:17,440
because i got him to say like when a

3822
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,719
country calls itself socialist that's

3823
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:20,080
enough and then i'm like well what about

3824
01:59:18,719 --> 01:59:23,760
nazi germany and he's like

3825
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:26,400
well no it's like well what do you mean

3826
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:31,840
uh yeah i don't know i should have

3827
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:31,840
cracked it on bezos

3828
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:42,880
overall you're happy with the results of

3829
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:43,199
the debate um yeah i think if i could

3830
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:45,360
have

3831
01:59:43,199 --> 01:59:46,880
wished for anything else i think i wish

3832
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:47,199
that lance would have stepped in more

3833
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:49,520
and

3834
01:59:47,199 --> 01:59:51,119
forced him to answer questions i really

3835
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:52,800
truly don't believe that

3836
01:59:51,119 --> 01:59:54,480
wolfe answered almost anything that i

3837
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:56,560
asked directly

3838
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:57,679
um and it felt weird for me to step in

3839
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:59,199
and interrupt him when we had a

3840
01:59:57,679 --> 02:00:00,239
moderator present i don't know if i

3841
01:59:59,199 --> 02:00:05,360
would have

3842
02:00:00,239 --> 02:00:06,719
um yeah i don't know

3843
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:13,119
lance did start stepping in he stepped

3844
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:14,239
in twice which i was surprised about but

3845
02:00:13,119 --> 02:00:15,920
i wish we could have talked about the

3846
02:00:14,239 --> 02:00:16,880
boom bust cycle more too there's some i

3847
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:17,920
wish we could have talked about anything

3848
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:19,599
in this conversation

3849
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:21,520
people said that boom bust cycles are

3850
02:00:19,599 --> 02:00:23,280
like inherent to capitalism i consider

3851
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:25,119
that a feature instead of a negative

3852
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:26,320
i think that one thing that i i should

3853
02:00:25,119 --> 02:00:28,000
have these studies in one hand

3854
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:28,880
um one thing i've read that capitalist

3855
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,239
countries are able to do more

3856
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:31,440
effectively than socialist countries is

3857
02:00:30,239 --> 02:00:32,800
capitalist countries are really good at

3858
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:34,320
responding to crises

3859
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:35,679
so a crisis happens in a capitalist

3860
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:36,719
country but it doesn't [ __ ] destroy

3861
02:00:35,679 --> 02:00:38,320
the capital's country

3862
02:00:36,719 --> 02:00:40,239
you have a bust but then you have a boom

3863
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:40,719
again like capitalist countries boom and

3864
02:00:40,239 --> 02:00:42,159
bust

3865
02:00:40,719 --> 02:00:43,760
but then they rebound right which is

3866
02:00:42,159 --> 02:00:45,199
we've seen this happen several times you

3867
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:46,480
know for him to point out like oh well

3868
02:00:45,199 --> 02:00:47,679
look at the great depression like oh

3869
02:00:46,480 --> 02:00:49,119
it's like oh cool well look where we are

3870
02:00:47,679 --> 02:00:49,920
now our country still exists where's the

3871
02:00:49,119 --> 02:00:50,960
ussr

3872
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:52,080
you know where are some of these other

3873
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:54,159
socialist regimes that have come and

3874
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:56,400
gone uh throughout history you know our

3875
02:00:54,159 --> 02:00:56,400
you know

3876
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:04,159
you failed at destroying wolf to end the

3877
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:05,520
lefty arc every left in the internet

3878
02:01:04,159 --> 02:01:06,639
thanks to straight every lefty is always

3879
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:08,159
gonna side with me i don't know where

3880
02:01:06,639 --> 02:01:09,840
i'll look to see how i feel like i did

3881
02:01:08,159 --> 02:01:11,199
in the middle i feel like my community

3882
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:12,719
which still has a lot of lefty

3883
02:01:11,199 --> 02:01:14,480
sympathetic [ __ ] in it things that i

3884
02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:15,840
did really well which is good for me

3885
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:17,440
um and then i'll have to try to dig

3886
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:19,040
through discourse i don't know what

3887
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:20,239
forms i'd look at later just to try to

3888
02:01:19,040 --> 02:01:21,440
gauge how i feel like i did maybe the

3889
02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:24,880
youtube comment section

3890
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:26,000
or something but lefties are brain dead

3891
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:29,440
so they're going to think that anybody

3892
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:29,440
that is on the left automatically wins

3893
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:37,840
anything

3894
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:47,520
do you think saying you shouldn't

3895
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:48,800
moralize your economic system as good

3896
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:49,760
phrasing such warding because people

3897
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:50,880
seem to interpret that as saying you

3898
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:51,760
should be allowed to take your moral

3899
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:53,040
actions again and

3900
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:55,599
uh if somebody wants to talk about more

3901
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:55,599
we can but

3902
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:05,760
it also felt like he didn't really yeah

3903
02:02:04,639 --> 02:02:07,119
i think i've said this before he didn't

3904
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:08,400
really engage with any of my points it

3905
02:02:07,119 --> 02:02:10,880
was more just he wanted to lecture i

3906
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:10,880
guess but

3907
02:02:12,639 --> 02:02:19,840
yeah um

3908
02:02:21,119 --> 02:02:24,080
all right i'm going to

3909
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:27,520
um i'm going to unmute doughnuts and

3910
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:28,639
start responding everything david

3911
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:30,239
pakman's community could be slightly

3912
02:02:28,639 --> 02:02:31,599
neutral no no no every

3913
02:02:30,239 --> 02:02:33,520
moderately left-leaning community on the

3914
02:02:31,599 --> 02:02:34,719
internet [ __ ] despises me because i'm

3915
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:36,480
not as cuck socialist

3916
02:02:34,719 --> 02:02:37,920
including david pakman's david pakman's

3917
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:39,520
community is pr is

3918
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:40,719
massively over representing like

3919
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:41,920
socialists at least in all their comment

3920
02:02:40,719 --> 02:02:43,840
sections other chats

3921
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:44,639
it's insane but even pacman himself has

3922
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:45,760
come out and said there are certain

3923
02:02:44,639 --> 02:02:46,000
things that he can't touch or talk about

3924
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:49,440
because

3925
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,440
this community is so far left leaning

3926
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,360
do you think him not engaging in your

3927
02:02:57,199 --> 02:03:00,800
points was more ageism maybe he's used

3928
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:01,920
to more formal structures of debate we

3929
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:02,800
don't really have a back and forth but

3930
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:05,440
you're just kind of lecturing the

3931
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:05,440
audience but

3932
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:16,080
what do you think about albert einstein

3933
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:18,159
being a socialist i don't know is albert

3934
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:19,679
einstein considered an inventor

3935
02:03:18,159 --> 02:03:21,040
one distinction that a lot of lefties

3936
02:03:19,679 --> 02:03:22,480
seem to have as well because albert

3937
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:24,320
einstein has brought up so much

3938
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:25,599
is there's a huge difference between

3939
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:27,199
creating a theory

3940
02:03:25,599 --> 02:03:28,719
and using that theory to create an

3941
02:03:27,199 --> 02:03:29,920
applicable product that can be brought

3942
02:03:28,719 --> 02:03:31,360
to market

3943
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:32,960
there's a big difference between coming

3944
02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:34,639
up with a theory and then coming up with

3945
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:38,239
a product that can be water sold

3946
02:03:34,639 --> 02:03:39,520
lefties make this mistake a lot when um

3947
02:03:38,239 --> 02:03:41,119
lefties make this mistake a lot when

3948
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:42,800
they talk about like oh well most

3949
02:03:41,119 --> 02:03:43,440
medical research is actually publicly

3950
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:46,000
funded

3951
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:47,280
that's great medical research does [ __ ]

3952
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:49,760
all for the average person

3953
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:51,199
what you need is a medical application

3954
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:52,960
we can have all the research in the

3955
02:03:51,199 --> 02:03:54,800
world but if you don't actually have a

3956
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:56,639
surgical procedure or a drug or

3957
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:57,840
treatment or therapy then none of that

3958
02:03:56,639 --> 02:03:58,960
research means [ __ ] all

3959
02:03:57,840 --> 02:04:00,159
what you need at the end of the day and

3960
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:01,920
what usually happens in private

3961
02:04:00,159 --> 02:04:03,440
enterprise is some company taking the

3962
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:04,480
research and finding a way to apply it

3963
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:06,079
to some therapy

3964
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:07,599
without the application the research is

3965
02:04:06,079 --> 02:04:08,719
meaningless there's a lot of public

3966
02:04:07,599 --> 02:04:10,400
research that goes on and it's

3967
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:12,079
incredibly valuable and that's awesome

3968
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:13,199
but the public is not responsible for

3969
02:04:12,079 --> 02:04:14,480
bringing drugs to market that is an

3970
02:04:13,199 --> 02:04:15,920
incredibly arduous process

3971
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:18,000
to figure out how do you pick winners

3972
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:18,800
and losers which ironically not

3973
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:21,360
ironically

3974
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:22,800
which it actually makes sense is one of

3975
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:25,199
the big problems

3976
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:26,000
with um is one of the big problems with

3977
02:04:25,199 --> 02:04:28,560
uh

3978
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,280
massively run co-op economies is that

3979
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:30,800
the government

3980
02:04:29,280 --> 02:04:32,320
ends up being the one that has to pick

3981
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:34,320
the winners and losers and historically

3982
02:04:32,320 --> 02:04:36,079
it's just been really hard to do this

3983
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:37,599
back when yugoslavia was a thing basket

3984
02:04:36,079 --> 02:04:39,040
sent me a paper because yugoslavia tried

3985
02:04:37,599 --> 02:04:40,400
to do a market socialism thing

3986
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:42,239
and it's a problem that a lot of like

3987
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:43,840
heavily centrally planned economies have

3988
02:04:42,239 --> 02:04:45,440
is they can't respond to change as well

3989
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:45,920
because there's so much bureaucracy in

3990
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:47,679
the way

3991
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:49,440
that trying to get like sectors of your

3992
02:04:47,679 --> 02:04:51,119
economy to adapt when you're not relying

3993
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:52,639
on market signals is almost impossible

3994
02:04:51,119 --> 02:04:53,920
it was an issue in venezuela it was an

3995
02:04:52,639 --> 02:04:54,800
incident in yugoslavia before it's

3996
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:56,960
dissolution

3997
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:58,239
um yeah it's just it's just it's but i

3998
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:59,599
mean it makes sense why this would be

3999
02:04:58,239 --> 02:05:01,119
the case it's just going to be

4000
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:02,400
like free-flowing capital markets can

4001
02:05:01,119 --> 02:05:04,000
just allocate capital to different

4002
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:07,840
sectors so [ __ ] quickly we see this

4003
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:07,840
happen right

4004
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:16,880
you're seeing pretty right and left at

4005
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:17,920
the same time like you want equitable

4006
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:19,280
distribution of resources but you're

4007
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:19,679
against any significant systemic changes

4008
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:21,199
could you

4009
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:22,400
elaborate a bit on your specific qualm

4010
02:05:21,199 --> 02:05:24,159
with the form of socialism that richard

4011
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:25,760
wolf advocates for similarly exclusively

4012
02:05:24,159 --> 02:05:26,960
democratization workplace because i

4013
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:27,599
don't think that democratizing a

4014
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:29,599
workplace

4015
02:05:27,599 --> 02:05:31,199
necessarily makes that workplace better

4016
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:32,880
i think that a lot of lefties

4017
02:05:31,199 --> 02:05:34,400
i i just don't i don't believe that's

4018
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:36,000
the case i'm sorry like

4019
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:37,199
i've had work experience before this

4020
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,800
jesus [ __ ] i don't want a lot of my

4021
02:05:37,199 --> 02:05:40,880
coworkers voting on what the [ __ ]

4022
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:42,480
happened to my particular workplace

4023
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:44,079
uh that might just be me or whatever but

4024
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:45,760
um yeah i don't know i think that there

4025
02:05:44,079 --> 02:05:47,199
are cases where democratizing parts of

4026
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:48,560
the workplace can be positive where the

4027
02:05:47,199 --> 02:05:48,880
workplace maybe could suit the worker

4028
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:50,880
better

4029
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:52,560
that's awesome but i would like to find

4030
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:53,760
ways to incorporate that in our current

4031
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:55,599
structure rather than

4032
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:57,040
force it to be that like private

4033
02:05:55,599 --> 02:06:02,400
investment has disallowed

4034
02:05:57,040 --> 02:06:04,639
in some society you know like

4035
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:06,079
people are upset right now because p you

4036
02:06:04,639 --> 02:06:06,639
know it's funny because wolfe was so

4037
02:06:06,079 --> 02:06:08,239
upset

4038
02:06:06,639 --> 02:06:09,840
that the democrats haven't enacted as

4039
02:06:08,239 --> 02:06:11,119
much left-leaning policy as they have in

4040
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:11,840
the united states well what is the case

4041
02:06:11,119 --> 02:06:13,920
for that right

4042
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:15,280
it's because of the american voter but

4043
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:16,960
now you want the american voter to be in

4044
02:06:15,280 --> 02:06:18,639
charge of every single workplace you

4045
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:20,239
want the same people that voted donald

4046
02:06:18,639 --> 02:06:21,440
trump into office to also be voting on

4047
02:06:20,239 --> 02:06:22,560
whether or not blacks and whites are

4048
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:23,920
treated equally at the worth

4049
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:25,679
of the workplace and you can sit there

4050
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:26,960
and argue well voters are changed

4051
02:06:25,679 --> 02:06:28,159
because of corporate control on blah

4052
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:29,440
blah blah blah it's like okay well how

4053
02:06:28,159 --> 02:06:30,320
wouldn't that happen in the workplace as

4054
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:31,760
well how do you think that there

4055
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:33,280
wouldn't be people that are wielding

4056
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:34,000
influence to influence but right these

4057
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:36,000
problems are

4058
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:37,360
are endemic to people not endemic to

4059
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:40,119
economic systems

4060
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:42,400
evils like bigotry and slavery and

4061
02:06:40,119 --> 02:06:43,440
homophobia and transphobia and all this

4062
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:44,880
stuff these these exist

4063
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:46,560
independent of any economic system they

4064
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:47,520
can exist under capitalism feudalism

4065
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:50,480
socialism

4066
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:52,800
anarchism uh monarchism whatever ism you

4067
02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:52,800
want

4068
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:59,840
deadbeat dadaism

4069
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,320
can you still be more specific about how

4070
02:07:03,360 --> 02:07:06,079
you thought he was moralizing his

4071
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:06,639
position socialism i missed the opening

4072
02:07:06,079 --> 02:07:08,000
of the debate

4073
02:07:06,639 --> 02:07:09,520
um because the idea that there is an

4074
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:11,119
employee and an employer i don't think

4075
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:12,400
that that relationship is inherently

4076
02:07:11,119 --> 02:07:13,760
wrong i don't think that relationship is

4077
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:15,119
inherently immoral and i think to just

4078
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:16,320
moralize it and say you win the argument

4079
02:07:15,119 --> 02:07:17,599
because you said that's wrong i don't i

4080
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:19,199
think that has to be demonstrated

4081
02:07:17,599 --> 02:07:20,480
we could go back and have a philosophy

4082
02:07:19,199 --> 02:07:21,119
debate on that because that's largely a

4083
02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:23,280
philosophy

4084
02:07:21,119 --> 02:07:25,040
that's wholly a philosophical assertion

4085
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:25,679
but i reject that i i would argue

4086
02:07:25,040 --> 02:07:26,880
against it

4087
02:07:25,679 --> 02:07:28,480
just because somebody provides you

4088
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:30,480
capital and you add some labor to it

4089
02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:30,719
that doesn't give you 100 ownership over

4090
02:07:30,480 --> 02:07:32,880
the

4091
02:07:30,719 --> 02:07:34,400
drop of labor added to some capital all

4092
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:35,679
of a sudden gives you ownership over the

4093
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:36,719
final product that's produced i would

4094
02:07:35,679 --> 02:07:37,840
argue that i would argue that on a

4095
02:07:36,719 --> 02:07:40,239
philosophical level

4096
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:41,360
um but i i don't know if lefties have

4097
02:07:40,239 --> 02:07:42,000
ever even thought about having those

4098
02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:44,000
arguments

4099
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:46,239
um the idea that adding a drop of labor

4100
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:47,119
to or a bit of labor to capital or uh

4101
02:07:46,239 --> 02:07:48,480
natural resource

4102
02:07:47,119 --> 02:07:50,400
all of a sudden gives you an entitlement

4103
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:52,000
100 to the newly created product

4104
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:53,280
i think is ridiculous just as ridiculous

4105
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
as saying the capitalist ought to own it

4106
02:07:53,280 --> 02:07:57,520
100

4107
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:57,520
and the laborer gets no pay for it

4108
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:08,880
i don't know i love the socialists using

4109
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:09,520
his academic credentials as it does yeah

4110
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:10,719
i didn't want to

4111
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:11,760
he said it in the earlier part of the

4112
02:08:10,719 --> 02:08:13,599
bit if he would have brought that up in

4113
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:15,119
the last part like i teach classes

4114
02:08:13,599 --> 02:08:16,880
like i would have reminded him you teach

4115
02:08:15,119 --> 02:08:17,280
undergraduate courses occasionally like

4116
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:18,960
that's

4117
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:20,639
like you're basically teaching glorified

4118
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:23,280
high school classes like let's chill on

4119
02:08:20,639 --> 02:08:24,960
the [ __ ] credentials bro okay

4120
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:26,159
but but but he brought that up i think

4121
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:27,679
earlier in the debate and i didn't want

4122
02:08:26,159 --> 02:08:37,840
to be like super combative about that

4123
02:08:27,679 --> 02:08:37,840
you know

4124
02:08:41,599 --> 02:08:44,000
he was wrong about democrats not making

4125
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:45,440
progress after the 30s you could have

4126
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,560
brought up on medicare medicaid civil

4127
02:08:45,440 --> 02:08:48,320
rights were all passed in the 60s

4128
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:50,320
section 8 was passed in 74.

4129
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:52,000
your own income tax rate was 75 oh sure

4130
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:54,719
yeah [ __ ] there there were like so many

4131
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:56,320
different things that i wanted to but

4132
02:08:54,719 --> 02:08:57,440
the problem is we couldn't settle on any

4133
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:59,119
issue i tried to say in the beginning

4134
02:08:57,440 --> 02:09:00,239
can we just go point by point but i

4135
02:08:59,119 --> 02:09:02,719
don't think it's stuck

4136
02:09:00,239 --> 02:09:04,480
um the problem is like any question i

4137
02:09:02,719 --> 02:09:06,159
would ask you'd say like point a b

4138
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:07,679
c d e f g and i'm like well okay let's

4139
02:09:06,159 --> 02:09:09,199
talk about point a oh thanks

4140
02:09:07,679 --> 02:09:10,719
let's talk a little bit about point a

4141
02:09:09,199 --> 02:09:12,079
and then he'd be like oh okay well let

4142
02:09:10,719 --> 02:09:13,679
me respond to a

4143

4145
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:19,599

4146
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:21,280
and he'd be like oh okay so a1 xyz

4147
02:09:19,599 --> 02:09:22,719

4148
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:24,000
just like i don't want to call i don't

4149
02:09:22,719 --> 02:09:25,440
want to use a debate bro term right but

4150
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,040
it is a little gish galloping i can't

4151
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:28,560
respond to every single point because

4152
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:30,159
when i ask for clarification on one

4153
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:30,719
thing we have to talk about 35 other

4154
02:09:30,159 --> 02:09:33,599
things

4155
02:09:30,719 --> 02:09:34,880
you know which damages my it gives it

4156
02:09:33,599 --> 02:09:37,440
makes him look more authoritative in the

4157
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:37,440
conversation

4158
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:42,560
in his three definitions of socialism it

4159
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:43,679
sounded like anything that isn't and cap

4160
02:09:42,560 --> 02:09:45,280
is socialism yeah

4161
02:09:43,679 --> 02:09:48,079
that first definition of socialism that

4162
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:50,960
he gave was so unbelievably wide

4163
02:09:48,079 --> 02:09:51,360
thanks it's like well [ __ ] me like what

4164
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:53,440
am i

4165
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:55,280
i mean like your definition of socialism

4166
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:57,520
includes private enterprise

4167
02:09:55,280 --> 02:09:58,880
wait what the [ __ ] is this what the f

4168
02:09:57,520 --> 02:10:00,000
how the [ __ ] am i supposed to argue with

4169
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:01,760
that your private enterprise

4170
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:03,119
and your socialism wait what the [ __ ]

4171
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:04,239
you have owners and employees i don't

4172
02:10:03,119 --> 02:10:04,800
even know what the [ __ ] i'm supposed to

4173
02:10:04,239 --> 02:10:07,440
say

4174
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:09,040
to that like what the [ __ ] like you you

4175
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:15,840
win you like auto won the debate

4176
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:15,840
like everything is socialism basically

4177
02:10:27,119 --> 02:10:29,840
ah

4178
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:34,159
do socialist economies have debt markets

4179
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:36,000
um

4180
02:10:34,159 --> 02:10:37,760
yeah i think i read about this on the

4181
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,639
venezuela example and the paper boss get

4182
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:39,920
linked me uh

4183
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:43,040
they have debt markets but those debt

4184
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:44,880
markets are also oh what [ __ ] what was i

4185
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:46,079
um what was i reading was it the eel

4186
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:47,520
lecture we listened to

4187
02:10:46,079 --> 02:10:49,360
the interesting problem that you run

4188
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:52,159
into with debt markets

4189
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:56,639
is that a co-op could theoretically make

4190
02:10:52,159 --> 02:10:57,760
itself out to be um could make itself

4191
02:10:56,639 --> 02:11:01,679
out to be

4192
02:10:57,760 --> 02:11:01,679
like a like a capitalist structure

4193
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:07,360
um hold on i'm trying to see where i

4194
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:08,719
read this

4195
02:11:07,360 --> 02:11:10,639
[ __ ] i don't remember where i read this

4196
02:11:08,719 --> 02:11:12,000
um the summary of this is basically

4197
02:11:10,639 --> 02:11:13,360
let's say that you have one co-op that

4198
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,560
runs a grocery store and then another

4199
02:11:13,360 --> 02:11:16,079
co-op that runs banks

4200
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:17,520
let's say that you go to the bank co-op

4201
02:11:16,079 --> 02:11:18,800
you're like hey we need to get you know

4202
02:11:17,520 --> 02:11:20,480
a loan for our business because we want

4203
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:22,079
to buy more buildings or whatever

4204
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:23,679
then that co-op can essentially say like

4205
02:11:22,079 --> 02:11:24,079
oh sure well we're going to own part of

4206
02:11:23,679 --> 02:11:25,199
your business

4207
02:11:24,079 --> 02:11:26,639
if you do it or you're going to owe us

4208
02:11:25,199 --> 02:11:27,760
part of the what you produce you're

4209
02:11:26,639 --> 02:11:28,480
going to get royalties or something like

4210
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:29,840
oh okay

4211
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:31,360
well now you've just recreated

4212
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:33,440
capitalism with more steps now you have

4213
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:35,040
an owner class the bank that bank co-op

4214
02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:36,960
becomes the owners of part of the

4215
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:37,679
business of the uh of the employee-owned

4216
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:39,280
co-op right

4217
02:11:37,679 --> 02:11:40,880
that is now has part employee ownership

4218
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:42,239
[ __ ] i wish i could just talk about

4219
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:43,840
capital markets for like 10 minutes with

4220
02:11:42,239 --> 02:11:44,960
a lefty because i feel like wolf was

4221
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:49,199
just totally like

4222
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:50,800
absolutely like like the reality is

4223
02:11:49,199 --> 02:11:52,000
let me explain this real quick okay in

4224
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:53,599
case you guys didn't understand this so

4225
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:55,199
some of you um yeah maybe maybe

4226
02:11:53,599 --> 02:11:57,280
some of you guys don't understand this

4227
02:11:55,199 --> 02:11:59,440
if i invest in a company

4228
02:11:57,280 --> 02:12:00,880
i have part ownership in that company

4229
02:11:59,440 --> 02:12:01,520
and there are other investors in that

4230
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:03,280
company

4231
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:04,480
when that company makes decisions it

4232
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:05,920
should be making decisions for the

4233
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:07,360
benefit of its investors it has a

4234
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:09,760
fiduciary responsibility

4235
02:12:07,360 --> 02:12:10,960
why is that the reason why that is is

4236
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:13,199
because if it didn't have that

4237
02:12:10,960 --> 02:12:14,400
responsibility to outside investors or

4238
02:12:13,199 --> 02:12:16,800
shareholders

4239
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:18,000
the problem is that they could just [ __ ]

4240
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:18,639
off with all the money and say [ __ ] it

4241
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
right

4242
02:12:18,639 --> 02:12:22,000
so here's the problem let's say there's

4243
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:23,440
a 100 employee company and let's say

4244
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,560
that this company wants to raise a [ __ ]

4245
02:12:23,440 --> 02:12:25,920
ton of money for expansion let's say

4246
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:27,520
that i can say oh okay i'll donate

4247
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:29,360
i'll uh i'll invest 10 million dollars

4248
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:31,119
in your company's like oh really okay

4249
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:32,560
well you get non-controlling shares

4250
02:12:31,119 --> 02:12:33,920
we'll give you 20 we're doing our

4251
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:35,520
valuation you get 20

4252
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:37,599
non-controlling shares there you go now

4253
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:39,280
you own 20 of our co-op oh cool

4254
02:12:37,599 --> 02:12:40,639
then let's say the cop is like hey guys

4255
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:42,480
we just got all this money

4256
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:44,159
uh we're literally not expanding [ __ ]

4257
02:12:42,480 --> 02:12:46,560
all we're just gonna pay 80

4258
02:12:44,159 --> 02:12:48,239
out um to all of the employees in in the

4259
02:12:46,560 --> 02:12:50,320
form of like wages or whatever like

4260
02:12:48,239 --> 02:12:51,840
get [ __ ] well as a private capital

4261
02:12:50,320 --> 02:12:54,960
investor now you're like

4262
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:57,119
oh well [ __ ] me i guess like

4263
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:59,040
why the [ __ ] would you ever invest into

4264
02:12:57,119 --> 02:12:59,840
a co-op that gives you non-controlling

4265
02:12:59,040 --> 02:13:01,920
shares

4266
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:03,280
why would you ever do that you're like i

4267
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:04,639
don't want to do that i'm only going to

4268
02:13:03,280 --> 02:13:05,199
invest in companies that guarantee a

4269
02:13:04,639 --> 02:13:06,800
return

4270
02:13:05,199 --> 02:13:08,400
or that should be making a good faith

4271
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:09,520
effort to provide a return to people

4272
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:11,280
that are shareholders

4273
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:12,400
like he kept saying that you were making

4274
02:13:11,280 --> 02:13:13,840
[ __ ] up yeah i know he started making

4275
02:13:12,400 --> 02:13:15,440
sure but this underlies every single

4276
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:17,440
capital investment in all of

4277
02:13:15,440 --> 02:13:19,040
a capitalist society you have to be

4278
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:20,320
otherwise nobody would invest in any

4279
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:21,520
project ever because people just take

4280
02:13:20,320 --> 02:13:22,880
your money and run with it and when

4281
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:24,079
people takes your money take your money

4282
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:25,119
and run with it they usually get [ __ ]

4283
02:13:24,079 --> 02:13:25,920
prosecuted by the government you gotta

4284
02:13:25,119 --> 02:13:26,800
let it do that look what i'm gonna

4285
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:28,800
[ __ ] march

4286
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:30,079
when i'm gonna end run when you commit

4287
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:31,280
fraud like that and you steal people's

4288
02:13:30,079 --> 02:13:32,480
money you get [ __ ] for it you're not

4289
02:13:31,280 --> 02:13:35,840
allowed to do that

4290
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:35,840
um yeah

4291
02:13:42,840 --> 02:13:48,079
[ __ ]

4292
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:49,040
wait so how do co-ops exist now co-ops

4293
02:13:48,079 --> 02:13:51,840
exist now

4294
02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:52,480
but a big problem with co-ops which i

4295
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:53,679
acknowledged

4296
02:13:52,480 --> 02:13:55,520
exists in which everybody should a big

4297
02:13:53,679 --> 02:13:56,719
problem with co-ops is directly related

4298
02:13:55,520 --> 02:14:00,000
to the problem that i'm giving

4299
02:13:56,719 --> 02:14:02,159
and the problem is that co-ops have a

4300
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:04,239
hard time raising capital because who

4301
02:14:02,159 --> 02:14:06,239
the [ __ ] is going to invest in a co-op

4302
02:14:04,239 --> 02:14:07,440
now there are some forms of investment

4303
02:14:06,239 --> 02:14:09,360
where i'll give you this much money and

4304
02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:10,800
you give me a royalty like on future

4305
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:12,480
sales or something you can do that

4306
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:13,840
but equity problems or cap initial

4307
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:16,320
capital funding problems for

4308
02:14:13,840 --> 02:14:17,599
um co-ops are a big deal it's hard it's

4309
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:18,480
really hard to start a club if i want to

4310
02:14:17,599 --> 02:14:19,840
start a business

4311
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:21,360
i've got to find 10 other people that

4312
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:22,800
have a [ __ ] ton of money that are all

4313
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:24,320
willing to come in evenly with me or

4314
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:25,520
somewhat evenly so that we can like

4315
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:27,199
start a business together because

4316
02:14:25,520 --> 02:14:27,760
raising outside capital is so [ __ ]

4317
02:14:27,199 --> 02:14:29,520
hard

4318
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:30,639
with uh with co-ops it's a problem that

4319
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:32,000
they face it's not that's not like

4320
02:14:30,639 --> 02:14:33,920
something i invented like you can you

4321
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:35,599
can go read up like co-op problems and

4322
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:41,840
um capital issues are one of the first

4323
02:14:35,599 --> 02:14:41,840
things that comes up

4324
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:47,040
why are co-ops not good options for

4325
02:14:45,679 --> 02:14:49,920
investors

4326
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:52,320
because a co-op is owned by the workers

4327
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:54,880
so the co-op is going to be maximizing

4328
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:56,159
returns and profits for the workers i

4329
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:56,880
don't want to buy into that as an

4330
02:14:56,159 --> 02:14:58,159
investor

4331
02:14:56,880 --> 02:14:59,840
because if i'm not a worker there i have

4332
02:14:58,159 --> 02:15:09,840
no guarantee that you're going to return

4333
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:09,840
any profit to me

4334
02:15:11,679 --> 02:15:16,320
i invested in a co-op and got fresh eggs

4335
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:16,320
every morning in return

4336
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:24,639
there's no guarantee regardless of what

4337
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:26,079
you're investing in for a privately held

4338
02:15:24,639 --> 02:15:27,679
company that it has

4339
02:15:26,079 --> 02:15:29,119
like shareholders there's they're

4340
02:15:27,679 --> 02:15:30,079
supposed to make a good faith effort to

4341
02:15:29,119 --> 02:15:31,119
return money to you

4342
02:15:30,079 --> 02:15:32,320
because that's where the decision making

4343
02:15:31,119 --> 02:15:33,360
comes from like the board of directors

4344
02:15:32,320 --> 02:15:35,119
and everything right

4345
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:37,840
for a co-op it's just workers voting on

4346
02:15:35,119 --> 02:15:37,840
things

4347
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:41,840
the owned by workers definition of

4348
02:15:40,639 --> 02:15:43,280
co-ops is not what both says right he

4349
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:44,480
just cares about workers control i mean

4350
02:15:43,280 --> 02:15:45,679
it's the same thing i mean he dances

4351
02:15:44,480 --> 02:15:47,679
around it it's hard to get him to commit

4352
02:15:45,679 --> 02:15:51,840
to like any particular thing

4353
02:15:47,679 --> 02:15:51,840
i don't know

4354
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:20,719
[ __ ] i should be eating this in my hands

4355
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:22,400
why did he argue that not all co-ops are

4356
02:16:20,719 --> 02:16:25,199
worker owned um

4357
02:16:22,400 --> 02:16:26,880
because like i don't know because

4358
02:16:25,199 --> 02:16:28,239
everything could because his system was

4359
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:29,440
ultimately flexible

4360
02:16:28,239 --> 02:16:30,800
i felt like he was saying that a cop

4361
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:31,440
doesn't have to be owned 100 of the

4362
02:16:30,800 --> 02:16:33,359
workers

4363
02:16:31,440 --> 02:16:34,800
a socialist economy could have private

4364
02:16:33,359 --> 02:16:36,479
investment in enterprise

4365
02:16:34,800 --> 02:16:37,840
like we don't necessarily need the

4366
02:16:36,479 --> 02:16:38,800
government to disa lot like i don't know

4367
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:40,880
just like

4368
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:42,399
basically socialism was everything like

4369
02:16:40,880 --> 02:16:47,840
that's what it that's what it felt like

4370
02:16:42,399 --> 02:16:47,840
yeah i don't know [ __ ] it

4371
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:05,760
also i feel like i didn't respond

4372
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:05,760
adequately to my because i looked up

4373
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:16,240
mom

4374
02:17:14,399 --> 02:17:17,920
china has hasn't had an explosion of

4375
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:21,040
growth

4376
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:28,479
in terms of their um like gdp per capita

4377
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:30,800
sure but when did that growth happen

4378
02:17:28,479 --> 02:17:32,559
china gdp per capita history china

4379
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:33,280
opened itself up to massive foreign

4380
02:17:32,559 --> 02:17:36,240
investment

4381
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:36,240
in like the 90s

4382
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:39,920
when do we see the explosion of growth

4383
02:17:39,280 --> 02:17:43,519
right

4384
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:44,800
it doesn't happen until um

4385
02:17:43,519 --> 02:17:46,240
i don't know how far back i can get this

4386
02:17:44,800 --> 02:17:47,439
graph to go but this [ __ ] is [ __ ]

4387
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:49,280
flatlined sometimes

4388
02:17:47,439 --> 02:17:50,719
negative right it seems like it wasn't

4389
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:51,920
until it started to open itself up to

4390
02:17:50,719 --> 02:17:53,679
massive foreign investment and it

4391
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:55,120
started to liberalize its economy more

4392
02:17:53,679 --> 02:17:57,439
that all of a sudden china saw these

4393
02:17:55,120 --> 02:18:00,479
massive growths in gdp

4394
02:17:57,439 --> 02:18:04,080
that's what i saw right also i [ __ ] i'm

4395
02:18:00,479 --> 02:18:04,080
not 100 sure this i wish i um

4396
02:18:05,120 --> 02:18:08,160
my understanding is that japan uh

4397
02:18:06,639 --> 02:18:09,519
japan's growth was superior to that of

4398
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:10,639
russia or the ussr

4399
02:18:09,519 --> 02:18:12,880
[ __ ] i need to go and look that up at

4400
02:18:10,639 --> 02:18:14,080
some point you give socialism credit for

4401
02:18:12,880 --> 02:18:14,399
that though yeah but it wasn't until

4402
02:18:14,080 --> 02:18:16,880
they

4403
02:18:14,399 --> 02:18:18,080
liberalized their economy that i don't

4404
02:18:16,880 --> 02:18:19,519
know the foreign direct investment the

4405
02:18:18,080 --> 02:18:20,479
fdi for china has been like a massive

4406
02:18:19,519 --> 02:18:22,800
driver of its growth i don't think

4407
02:18:20,479 --> 02:18:22,800
anybody

4408
02:18:23,760 --> 02:18:27,040
he also said that they invested because

4409
02:18:25,439 --> 02:18:28,000
china had an educated population even

4410
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:29,040
though

4411
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:31,120
half the country couldn't read in the

4412
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:31,599
80s oh yeah and then him trying to say

4413
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:33,200
that like

4414
02:18:31,599 --> 02:18:35,200
people went to china because of like a

4415
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:36,160
cheap labor for dude that almost sounded

4416
02:18:35,200 --> 02:18:37,280
like a self-owned

4417
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:38,800
but i didn't get to push him because he

4418
02:18:37,280 --> 02:18:40,000
went on for like 12 minutes he was like

4419
02:18:38,800 --> 02:18:40,880
no that's not true people actually

4420
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
wanted to come to china because there's

4421
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:42,800
a lot of people willing to work for

4422
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,319
cheap like

4423
02:18:42,800 --> 02:18:45,439
what how is this is that are you

4424
02:18:44,319 --> 02:18:46,559
supporting your argument or my are you

4425
02:18:45,439 --> 02:18:48,240
basically saying that other countries go

4426
02:18:46,559 --> 02:18:52,559
to china and exploit their labor force

4427
02:18:48,240 --> 02:19:07,840
and that's like a big win for china [ __ ]

4428
02:18:52,559 --> 02:19:07,840
but [ __ ] me whatever

4429
02:19:17,439 --> 02:19:20,639
oh yeah eric the trade relationships

4430
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:22,080
helped a lot as well when china began to

4431
02:19:20,639 --> 02:19:24,479
take its foreign trade more seriously

4432
02:19:22,080 --> 02:19:24,479
for sure

4433
02:19:28,559 --> 02:19:35,840
dsp got unpartnered oh no

4434
02:19:32,479 --> 02:19:35,840
uh oh

4435
02:19:55,280 --> 02:19:59,760
oh [ __ ] stocked unless twitter

4436
02:19:58,319 --> 02:20:03,120
following who's not impressed with

4437
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:04,640
wolves performance

4438
02:20:03,120 --> 02:20:06,479
these are the types of comments that i

4439
02:20:04,640 --> 02:20:08,640
look for to know that i did

4440
02:20:06,479 --> 02:20:10,240
very well when somebody says it was a

4441
02:20:08,640 --> 02:20:12,080
deeply unsatisfying debate i don't think

4442
02:20:10,240 --> 02:20:13,439
destiny comes out of this looking better

4443
02:20:12,080 --> 02:20:15,200
but i thought wolf didn't really look

4444
02:20:13,439 --> 02:20:16,240
good when i see comments like that made

4445
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:18,240
by people that i know

4446
02:20:16,240 --> 02:20:19,280
[ __ ] hate me then i usually feel like

4447
02:20:18,240 --> 02:20:20,560
oh okay i think i did

4448
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:22,560
i probably did really well in this

4449
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:24,160
conversation that's usually like because

4450
02:20:22,560 --> 02:20:24,800
i'll see the types of things on like um

4451
02:20:24,160 --> 02:20:25,840
4chan

4452
02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:27,920
where people will be like even though

4453
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:29,840
destiny is like a bisexual cuck

4454
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:31,040
whatever like words people call me like

4455
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:32,399
i think that this wasn't the best

4456
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:33,680
showing for lauren southern or sorry

4457
02:20:32,399 --> 02:20:35,120
when i read comments like that usually i

4458
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:45,840
know that the conversation went really

4459
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:45,840
well for me

4460
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:50,560
does sdl hate you no i think me and

4461
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:51,200
stockton left are good his community

4462
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:52,479
hates me though

4463
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:53,840
every single left-leaning community

4464
02:20:52,479 --> 02:20:54,880
[ __ ] hates me there's not a single

4465
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:57,040
exception to that

4466
02:20:54,880 --> 02:20:58,720
on the internet unironically i'm not

4467
02:20:57,040 --> 02:21:00,160
even being hyperbolic

4468
02:20:58,720 --> 02:21:02,000
i feel like lance asked him that

4469
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:03,520
question and what wolf was supposed to

4470
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,720
say well of course you'd have your ps5s

4471
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:05,680
and your other luxury goods and any

4472
02:21:04,720 --> 02:21:07,439
socialist society

4473
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:08,560
all of the workers would collectively be

4474
02:21:07,439 --> 02:21:10,080
agreeing to make these goods and

4475
02:21:08,560 --> 02:21:10,479
services for one another the difference

4476
02:21:10,080 --> 02:21:12,800
is

4477
02:21:10,479 --> 02:21:13,840
is that when we produce ps5s the average

4478
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:15,600
worker is the one that's getting

4479
02:21:13,840 --> 02:21:17,359
rewarded for that not some technocratic

4480
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:18,560
bureaucratic person way at the end some

4481
02:21:17,359 --> 02:21:19,600
owner-class person

4482
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:21,359
at the end of the line i feel like that

4483
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:22,560
was supposed to be wolves answer so of

4484
02:21:21,359 --> 02:21:24,000
course you get your goods and services

4485
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:25,040
but now when you buy a ps5 you know that

4486
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,080
money is going into the hands of the

4487
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:29,040
workers that made it

4488
02:21:26,080 --> 02:21:30,080
not some not some owner that's way past

4489
02:21:29,040 --> 02:21:31,120
the line of not even having to do

4490
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:32,000
anything with the production of it i

4491
02:21:31,120 --> 02:21:32,880
feel like that was the answer he's

4492
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,160
supposed to give

4493
02:21:32,880 --> 02:21:35,600
but then he was like well i don't know

4494
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:36,240
you'd have to go debate your worker into

4495
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:38,800
going to

4496
02:21:36,240 --> 02:21:40,960
to work to make one for you overall i

4497
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:42,479
think your interruptions of wolf were

4498
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:45,200
kind of annoying

4499
02:21:42,479 --> 02:21:46,240
just comes off as needlessly aggressive

4500
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:49,040
but i agree that

4501
02:21:46,240 --> 02:21:49,439
moralizing socialism is stupid they

4502
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:51,439
can't

4503
02:21:49,439 --> 02:21:53,920
or don't know how to make economic

4504
02:21:51,439 --> 02:21:54,399
arguments so they default to capitalism

4505
02:21:53,920 --> 02:21:56,160
bad

4506
02:21:54,399 --> 02:21:59,120
i felt like i had to interrupt because

4507
02:21:56,160 --> 02:22:01,280
he was like he was going on for so

4508
02:21:59,120 --> 02:22:03,040
long like i was getting gish gallop so

4509
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:03,760
[ __ ] hard he would bring up like 30

4510
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:05,520
things

4511
02:22:03,760 --> 02:22:08,479
i'm sorry i interrupted the donut like

4512
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:09,439
holy [ __ ] i was getting steamrolled

4513
02:22:08,479 --> 02:22:11,600
and then he was trying to interrupt me

4514
02:22:09,439 --> 02:22:14,240
what i was trying to answer [ __ ]

4515
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:15,120
don't feel bad destiny this was not a

4516
02:22:14,240 --> 02:22:17,920
debate

4517
02:22:15,120 --> 02:22:19,920
he just rambled and ignored your points

4518
02:22:17,920 --> 02:22:22,240
you sort of gave up by the end so it

4519
02:22:19,920 --> 02:22:24,240
came off as you accepting defeat

4520
02:22:22,240 --> 02:22:26,080
so he came across as the winner without

4521
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:29,280
making any concrete points

4522
02:22:26,080 --> 02:22:30,640
uh i don't know about that yeah wolf was

4523
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:31,439
speaking during my closing statement

4524
02:22:30,640 --> 02:22:33,280
true

4525
02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:35,040
um do you think referring to him as

4526
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:38,319
professors a little past progressive

4527
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:39,520
um i tried not to actually i i

4528
02:22:38,319 --> 02:22:40,720
maybe i should have i should have

4529
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:41,760
actually no i should have asked at the

4530
02:22:40,720 --> 02:22:43,680
beginning i thought that you were

4531
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:44,560
supposed to refer to a professor as

4532
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:47,520
professor

4533
02:22:44,560 --> 02:22:48,080
um like i don't know i can't call him

4534
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:50,160
richard

4535
02:22:48,080 --> 02:22:51,359
and addressing him as mr wolfe i think

4536
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:53,680
sounds also

4537
02:22:51,359 --> 02:22:55,040
um kind of weird i thought i thought it

4538
02:22:53,680 --> 02:22:55,840
was like professor the professor

4539
02:22:55,040 --> 02:22:58,560
i thought that's like how you're

4540
02:22:55,840 --> 02:23:00,080
supposed to like unironically how you're

4541
02:22:58,560 --> 02:23:01,600
supposed to refer to somebody that has a

4542
02:23:00,080 --> 02:23:03,040
phd

4543
02:23:01,600 --> 02:23:05,200
that's my understanding i don't know how

4544
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:08,240
else i would um

4545
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:10,640
would refer to him as getting him into

4546
02:23:08,240 --> 02:23:12,720
exchanges where he is forced to actually

4547
02:23:10,640 --> 02:23:14,720
address what you say without lecturing

4548
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:15,920
for minutes at a time is much better

4549
02:23:14,720 --> 02:23:18,080
conversation

4550
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:19,520
then he talks to you instead of lectures

4551
02:23:18,080 --> 02:23:21,120
if you slash

4552
02:23:19,520 --> 02:23:22,640
yeah that's what i try to do but i don't

4553
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:23,760
think we ever got to do that it's really

4554
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:24,640
really hard i had the same problem with

4555
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:26,000
the pogen guy

4556
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:28,319
we're like can we just have like a

4557
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:29,680
real-life conversation where we go back

4558
02:23:28,319 --> 02:23:31,439
and forth and get to the bottom of this

4559
02:23:29,680 --> 02:23:33,040
particular thing rather than it feeling

4560
02:23:31,439 --> 02:23:34,720
like i'm on a prime case panel

4561
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:36,000
where every person just wants to come on

4562
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:37,439
and like give like their four-minute

4563
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,479
monologue and not respond to anything

4564
02:23:37,439 --> 02:23:40,319
other person said

4565
02:23:38,479 --> 02:23:41,520
i wish that uh i wish that he would have

4566
02:23:40,319 --> 02:23:43,680
i wish that we could have gone back and

4567
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:45,280
forth on a point more concretely

4568
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:46,960
i think that rhetorically i think i was

4569
02:23:45,280 --> 02:23:48,080
relatively effective i don't think he

4570
02:23:46,960 --> 02:23:49,280
brought up anything that i wasn't ready

4571
02:23:48,080 --> 02:23:50,479
to respond to like i didn't get

4572
02:23:49,280 --> 02:23:52,160
blindsided from anything

4573
02:23:50,479 --> 02:23:54,240
um i think that was just a matter a

4574
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:55,680
matter of like managing the conversation

4575
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:56,880
uh i think that there were some things

4576
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:58,319
that sucked but i don't know like

4577
02:23:56,880 --> 02:23:59,280
reasonably what was in my power to do

4578
02:23:58,319 --> 02:24:01,600
things about

4579
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:02,560
um like when somebody wants to ramble

4580
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:03,280
that much and there's a moderator

4581
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:04,960
present doesn't stop

4582
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:07,439
i don't know what i can do in that case

4583
02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:08,479
um i tried to hold him down to an answer

4584
02:24:07,439 --> 02:24:10,080
but i don't think we ever

4585
02:24:08,479 --> 02:24:11,520
got there we what did we go back and

4586
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:12,880
forth we went back and forth on

4587
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:14,000
something oh we didn't have a response

4588
02:24:12,880 --> 02:24:17,120
to it i don't know if that landed

4589
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:18,479
well that um like i'm more

4590
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:20,720
what did i say i'm more comfortable

4591
02:24:18,479 --> 02:24:22,319
blaming chernobyl on socialism than i am

4592
02:24:20,720 --> 02:24:23,200
blaming the coronavis pandemic on

4593
02:24:22,319 --> 02:24:24,640
capitalism

4594
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:25,600
he didn't have any response to that and

4595
02:24:24,640 --> 02:24:26,560
i feel like if he would have had a

4596
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:28,080
strong response that i feel like he

4597
02:24:26,560 --> 02:24:29,680
would have cut in and given one can you

4598
02:24:28,080 --> 02:24:30,720
clarify the japan vs ussr growth

4599
02:24:29,680 --> 02:24:32,399
rebuttal you made

4600
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:34,800
uh i don't think that the massive growth

4601
02:24:32,399 --> 02:24:36,479
of the ussr came under the soviet union

4602
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:37,520
but i'm not 100 i didn't know i didn't

4603
02:24:36,479 --> 02:24:38,640
know he's going to defend the soviet

4604
02:24:37,520 --> 02:24:40,399
union so much i thought he largely

4605
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:41,359
disowns the soviet union [ __ ]

4606
02:24:40,399 --> 02:24:42,720
because usually i think what we heard

4607
02:24:41,359 --> 02:24:43,840
him in the base he's like he's just like

4608
02:24:42,720 --> 02:24:44,880
oh i'm not talking about the soviet

4609
02:24:43,840 --> 02:24:45,920
union i don't think we heard him defend

4610
02:24:44,880 --> 02:24:47,600
the soviet union so much

4611
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:49,439
my understanding is that japan had more

4612
02:24:47,600 --> 02:24:50,319
growth um over the soviet union the

4613
02:24:49,439 --> 02:24:51,760
soviet union did

4614
02:24:50,319 --> 02:24:52,960
um and then [ __ ] and then i've heard

4615
02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:53,760
like i've got like collections of facts

4616
02:24:52,960 --> 02:24:54,640
but i haven't put them all together

4617
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:56,240
because i just don't know much about

4618
02:24:54,640 --> 02:24:57,359
like the history like the founding of

4619
02:24:56,240 --> 02:24:59,840
the soviet new river

4620
02:24:57,359 --> 02:25:01,680
um the cheshire uh cat guy diamond he

4621
02:24:59,840 --> 02:25:03,120
said russia was europe's third largest

4622
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:05,040
economy behind britain and germany by

4623
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:07,359
the year 1913.

4624
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:08,640
um france was poorer than the soviet

4625
02:25:07,359 --> 02:25:09,920
union as was the dutch republic and

4626
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:11,040
belgium all of which manage not to

4627
02:25:09,920 --> 02:25:12,080
masturbate to their own populations with

4628
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:13,840
poor economic planning

4629
02:25:12,080 --> 02:25:15,040
so yeah [ __ ] i i just i don't know the

4630
02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:16,800
comparative conditions in the early

4631
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:20,240
early 1900s across europe

4632
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:23,359
to compare to the start of the ussr um

4633
02:25:20,240 --> 02:25:25,359
but after this disappointing showing

4634
02:25:23,359 --> 02:25:26,720
from wolff you should definitely debate

4635
02:25:25,359 --> 02:25:28,720
david friedman

4636
02:25:26,720 --> 02:25:30,960
